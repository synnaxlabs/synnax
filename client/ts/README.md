# Synnax TypeScript Client Library

The Synnax TypeScript client library is used for interacting with a Synnax cluster. The
client library can be used in both node and browser environments. The [Synnax
documentation
website](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/typescript-client/get-started) contains
more information about using the TypeScript client.

## Installation

If you want to install the client library, please install it via a package manager such
as npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @synnaxlabs/client
```

## Examples

Examples of usage of the TypeScript client can be found in our [examples
folder](examples/node).
