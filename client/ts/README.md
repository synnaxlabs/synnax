# Synnax TypeScript Client Library

The Synnax TypeScript client library is used for interacting with a Synnax cluster. The
client library can be used in both node and browser environments. The
[Synnax documentation website](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/client/quick-start)
contains more information about using the TypeScript client.

## Installation

If you want to install the client library, please install it via a package manager such
as npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @synnaxlabs/client
```

## Examples

Examples of usage of the TypeScript client can be found in our
[examples folder](examples/node).

## Development

contribution guides.
