 * @remarks
 * This function implements the following logic:
 * - For each requested object, check if any policy allows the action
 * - A policy allows an action if:
 *   1. The policy's actions include the requested action OR "*" (all actions)
 *   2. The policy's objects include the requested object, either:
 *      - Type-level match: policy object has empty key and matching type
 *      - Instance-level match: policy object has matching type and key
 * - ALL requested objects must be allowed for the request to succeed
