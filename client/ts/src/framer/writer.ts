/**
 * Writer is used to write telemetry to a set of channels in time order.
 * It should not be instantiated directly, and should instead be instantiated via the
 * FramerClient {@link FrameClient#openWriter}.
 *
 * The writer is a streaming protocol that is heavily optimized for performance. This
 * comes at the cost of increased complexity, and should only be used directly when
 * writing large volumes of data (such as recording telemetry from a sensor or ingesting
 * data from file). Simpler methods (such as the frame client's write method) should
 * be used for most use cases.
 *
 * The protocol is as follows:
 *
 * 1. The writer is opened with a starting timestamp and a list of channel keys. The
 * writer will fail to open if the starting timestamp overlaps with any existing telemetry
 * for any channels specified. If the writer opens successfully, the caller is then
 * free to write frames to the writer.
 *
 * 2. To write a frame, the caller can use the write method and follow the validation
 * rules described in its method's documentation. This process is asynchronous, meaning
 * that write calls may return before teh frame has been written to the cluster. This
 * also means that the writer can accumulate an error after write is called. If the writer
 * accumulates an error, all subsequent write and commit calls will return False. The
 * caller can check for errors by calling the error method, which returns the accumulated
 * error and resets the writer for future use. The caller can also check for errors by
 * closing the writer, which will throw any accumulated error.
 *
 * 3. To commit the written frames to the cluster, the caller can call the commit method.
 * Unlike write, commit is synchronous, meaning that it will not return until the frames
 * have been written to the cluster. If the writer has accumulated an error, commit will
 * return false. After the caller acknowledges the error, they can attempt to commit again.
 * Commit can be called several times throughout a writer's lifetime, and will only
 * commit the frames that have been written since the last commit.
 *
 * 4. A writer MUST be closed after use in order to prevent resource leaks. Close should
 * typically be called in a 'finally' block. If the writer has accumulated an error,
 * close will throw the error.
