// --- VERY IMPORTANT ---
// Synnax's encoders (in the binary package inside x) automatically convert the case of
// keys in objects to snake_case and back to camelCase when encoding and decoding
// respectively. This is done to ensure that the keys are consistent across all
// languages and platforms. Sometimes items have keys that are uuids, which have dashes,
// and those get messed up. So we just use regular JSON for these items.
