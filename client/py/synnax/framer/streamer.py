    """A streamer is used to stream frames of telemetry in real-time from a Synnax
    cluster. It should not be constructed directly, and should instead be created using
    the client's `open_streamer` method.

    To open a streamer, use the `open_streamer` method on the client and pass in the
    list of channels you'd like to stream. Once a new streamer has been opened, you
    can call the `read` method to read the next frame of telemetry. Once done, call
    the `close` method to close the streamer and free all necessary resources. We
    recommend using the streamer as a context manager to ensure that it is closed
    properly.

    Streamers also support the iterator protocol, allowing you to iterate over the
    frames of telemetry as they are received. This is useful when you want to process
    each frame as it is received.
