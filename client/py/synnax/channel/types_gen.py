    storage and streaming in Synnax.

    Attributes:
        key: Is the unique identifier for this channel, automatically assigned
            by Synnax.
        name: Is the human-readable channel name.
        leaseholder: Is the cluster node that holds the lease for this channel. Mostly
            for internal use.
        data_type: Is the data type of samples stored in this channel (e.g., Float64,
            Int32, TimeStamp).
        is_index: Is true if this is an index channel. Index channels must have int64
            values (TIMESTAMP data type) written in ascending order, and are
            most commonly unix nanosecond timestamps.
        index: Is the channel used to index this channel's values, associating
            each value with a timestamp. If zero, the channel's data will be
            indexed using its rate.
        alias: Is an optional alternate name for the channel within a specific context.
        virtual: Is true if this channel does not store data in the database but can
            still be used for streaming purposes.
        internal: Is true if this is a system channel hidden from normal user queries.
        expression: Is an Arc expression for calculated channels. If set, the channel
            is automatically configured as virtual.
        operations: Contains optional aggregation operations (min, max, avg) applied to
            channel data over time or triggered by a reset channel.
        concurrency: Sets the policy for concurrent writes to the channel's data. Only
            virtual channels can have a policy of shared concurrency.
        status: Is the current operational status of the channel.
