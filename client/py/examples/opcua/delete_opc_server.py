This script deletes the OPC UA test server device from Synnax.

If the device is not found, the script exits with an appropriate message.
Otherwise, it prompts for confirmation before deleting.

Before running this example:
1. Start the Synnax Driver (if not already running).

2. Login to Synnax (if not already logged in):
   poetry run sy login

3. Run this script:
   poetry run python examples/opcua/delete_opc_server.py

Note: You do NOT need the OPC UA test server running to delete the device.
      This script only removes the device registration from Synnax.

Configuration:
    Modify the constants below to match your OPC UA server configuration.
