"""
This script connects to the OPC UA test server by registering it as a device in Synnax.

If the device is already connected, the script exits successfully.
Otherwise, it prompts to create a new OPC UA device connection automatically.

Before running this example:
1. Start the Synnax Driver (if not already running).

2. Start the OPC UA test server:
   poetry run python driver/opc/dev/server_extended.py

3. Login to Synnax (if not already logged in):
   poetry run sy login

4. Run this script:
   poetry run python examples/opcua/connect_opc_server.py

Configuration:
    Modify the constants below to match your OPC UA server configuration.
