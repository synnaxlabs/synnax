"""
This example demonstrates how to calculate derived values from a set of channels and
write them to a new set of channels in Synnax in a streaming fashion. These channels,
typically referred to as "calculated" or "derived" channels, are useful for storing
values that are calculated from other channels.

For this example to run, you'll need to run the `stream_write.py` script before you run
this script.
