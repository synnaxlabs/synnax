"""
This example demonstrates how to configure and start a sequence on a Synnax cluster.

This script will create two sequences. The first sequence will generate a float32 sine
wave and a uint8 sawtooth wave. The second sequence will read both waves, and change the
inputs to a modulated waveform and a uint7 sawtooth wave.

A sequence is a task that is used to execute a script on a Synnax driver. The script is
written in Lua and is used to control the behavior of the sequence. For more information
about sequences in general, visit
https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/control/embedded.
