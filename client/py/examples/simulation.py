This example demonstrates streaming data from a large number of channels into Synnax,
while also acknowledging commands sent to a large number of simulated valves. This
example serves as a basic simulated data acquisition system (DAQ). While this example is
running, you could open a schematic in the Synnax Console to control valves and view
sensors.
