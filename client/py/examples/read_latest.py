"""
This example demonstrates how to read the latest N samples from Synnax channels. We'll:
1. Create an index channel for timestamps and a data channel for values
2. Write some sample data to these channels
3. Read the latest N samples using an iterator
4. Print the results

This pattern is useful for real-time monitoring applications where you need to access
the most recent data points.
