"""
This example demonstrates how to stream live data from a channel in Synnax.
Live-streaming is useful for real-time data processing and analysis, and is an
integral part of Synnax's control sequence and data streaming capabilities.

This example is meant to be used in conjunction with the `stream_write.py` example, and
assumes that example is running in a separate terminal.
