"""
This example demonstrates how to calculate the average of two sensor channels that are
being sampled at different rates, using numpy's interpolation function to correctly
align the timestamps of the two channels. This example is more complex than the
`simple_average.py` example, and requires more computational resources to run.

This example must be run in conjunction with the `simulated_daq.py` file in this
directory. Run the `simulated_daq.py` file first, and then run this file.
