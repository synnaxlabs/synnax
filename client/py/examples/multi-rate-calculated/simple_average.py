"""
This example demonstrates how to  calculate the average of two sensor channels that are
being sampled at different rates. This example uses a naive method that simply grabs and
uses the latest value from each channel. This approach is simple, computationally
inexpensive, and works well when both channels are operating at consistent rates. Good
examples of this are a sensor operating at 100Hz and another at 50Hz.

This example must be run in conjunction with the `simulated_daq.py` file in this
directory. Run the `simulated_daq.py` file first, and then run this file.
