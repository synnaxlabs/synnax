This example sets up a simulated data acquisition system (DAQ) that writes data to two
channels at different rates (along with their indexes). This example should be run in
conjunction with the `interpolation.py` example or the `simple_average.py` example to
demonstrate how to calculate derived values from these channels with different rates.
