"""
This is a simple simulated data acquisition computer (DAQ) that has two valves and a
single pressure sensor. When the press valve is open (press_vlv), the pressure
increases. When the vent valve is open (vent_vlv), the pressure decreases. The pressure
(sensor_0) is sampled at a rate of 50 Hz.

Valves (or any commanded actuator), typically have three associated channels:

1. The command channel - this is where commands are sent down to actuate the valve.
2. The command channel time - stores the timestamps for the command channel,
and 'indexes' the command channel.
3. The state channel - this is where the state of the valve is stored. The DAQ updates
this value when a command is executed. The state channel is indexed by the regular DAQ
timestamp channel.

If you want to add another valve to your simulation, follow the same pattern explained
above using the code below as reference.
