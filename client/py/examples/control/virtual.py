This example is a short example that demonstrates how to use a virtual channel to
communicate through a Synnax cluster. A channel named 'signal' is created, and when
another process (such as the Synnax Console) writes a value of 1 to this channel, the
script prints out 'Signal received'.

with client.control.acquire(
    name="Signal Listener", read=["signal"], write=None
) as controller:
    controller.wait_until(lambda auto: auto["signal"] == 1)
