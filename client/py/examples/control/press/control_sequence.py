This example simulates a basic control sequence where a tank with pressure represented
by press_pt is pressurized in 20 psi increments. The tank is then vented after holding
down to 5 psi after a period of time.

This script requires the `simulated_daq.py` script to be running in order to simulate
the data acquisition system (DAQ).

This script can be visualized in the Synnax Console by connecting the press_pt channel
to a line plot and making a schematic that shows valves representing press_vlv_cmd and
vent_vlv_cmd and a tank with a value representing press_pt.
