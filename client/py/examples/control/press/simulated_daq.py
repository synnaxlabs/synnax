"""
This example sets up a simulated data acquisition system (DAQ) that has a press valve
(press_vlv_cmd) and vent valve (vent_vlv_cmd) connected to a pressure transducer
(press_pt). When the press valve is open, the pressure increases, and when the vent
valve is open, the pressure decreases. The pressure is written to the press_pt channel.

This script can be run in conjuction with the `control_sequence.py` script to
demonstrate how a control sequence can be written in Synnax.
