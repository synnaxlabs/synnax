# Tank Pressurization Control Sequence

This directory contains a control sequence to simulate a tank-pressure control (TPC)
test sequence. TPC sequences are commonly used to control the pressure in rocket
propellant tanks.

## Files

This directory contains several files:

- `common.py`: The names of the valves and sensors on the TPC system.
- `control_sequence.py`: The main control sequence that runs the pressurization and
  venting process. This sequence also reruns the test with more optimal control bounds.
- `simulated_daq.py`: A data acquisition computer (DAQ) that simulates how a real
  pressurization system would respond to the commands issued by the control sequence.
- `threshold_detection.py`: A script that will automatically create
  [ranges](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/concepts/ranges) when the fuel tank
  pressure rises above a certain threshold.

## Running the Example

To run the example, make sure you have:

1. A Synnax cluster running locally. See the [Quick
   Start](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/cluster/quick-start) guide for more
   information.
2. The Synnax Python client installed. See the [Getting
   Started](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/python-client/get-started) guide for more information.
3. Optionally, the Synnax Console installed and set up to visualize the data
   generated by the control sequence. See the [Getting Started](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/console/get-started) guide for more information.

If you are using the Console, you can use a combination of
[Schematics](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/console/schematics) and [Line
Plots](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/console/line-plots) to visualize the state
of the system over time.

Once you have a Synnax cluster running, start the simulated DAQ by running the
following command:

```bash
python simulated_daq.py
```

Then, run the control sequence by running the following command:

```bash
python control_sequence.py
```

You can also optionally run the threshold detection sequence by running the following
file:

```bash
python threshold_detection.py
```

The control sequence will run and you should see the pressure in the system increase and
decrease over time. You should also see the state of the pressurization system update in
the Console.
