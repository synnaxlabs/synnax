This example demonstrates how to stream live data from a channel in Synnax.
Live-streaming is useful for real-time data processing and analysis, and is an integral
part of Synnax's control sequence and data streaming capabilities.

This example requires the `stream_write.py` file to be running in a separate terminal.
