"""
This example demonstrates how to configure and start a Counter Read Task on a National
Instruments USB-6289 device to measure frequency and count edges.

To run this example, you'll need to have your Synnax cluster properly configured to
detect National Instruments devices: https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/driver/ni/get-started

You'll also need to have either a Counter Input module or create a simulated device
via the NI-MAX software.
