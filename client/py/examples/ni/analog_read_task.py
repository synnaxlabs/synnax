"""
This examples demonstrates how to configure and start an Analog Read Task on a National
Instruments USB-6289 device.

To run this example, you'll need to have your Synnax cluster properly configured to
detect National Instruments devices: https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/device-drivers/ni/get-started

You'll also need to have either a physical USB-6289 device or create a simulated device
via the NI-MAX software.
