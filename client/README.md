# Synnax Client

The Synnax client is a set of programming libraries for interacting with the Synnax
server. The clients can be used to connect to a server and read, write, and stream data.
The client libraries can be used to build analysis tools, device, GUIs, and much more.
The following languages are currently implemented:

- [C++](./cpp/)
- [Python](./py/README.md)
- [TypeScript](./ts/README.md)
