// Key is a unique identifier for a rack. Each rack is leased to a particular
// node in the cluster. Why this over a UUID?
//
// The reason comes down to task configuration and communication mechanisms. Task
// configuration signals are passed down through gossip operations, which are much
// slower than regular channel communication. This means that gossip propagation
// through a large cluster means that it can take 15s+ for a task to be received and
// configured by a rack. By leasing a rack to the node it connects to, we can minimize
// the number of hops and the time it takes for a task to be configured.
//
// The downside is that it makes it challenging to move tasks between racks.
//
// The first 16 bits are the node key, and the last 16 bits are a unique, sequential
// key for the rack on the node.
