    # (3) Gate overall coverage so it cannot go down vs the base commit.
    # Codecov config can enforce "no decrease" reliably; it cannot strictly
    # require "must increase" (strictly greater) via yaml alone.

    # (1) New/changed code must be >= 80% covered.
    # (2) Deletions won't hurt patch coverage; Codecov patch coverage is based
    # on added/modified lines, so removing uncovered lines doesn't fail this check.
