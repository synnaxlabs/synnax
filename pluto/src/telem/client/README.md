# Pluto Telemetry Client and Cache

This directory contains the source code for the client and caching mechanisms used
for various pluto components (line plots, valves, values, etc.) to fetch data from
a Synnax cluster. The design of this client is relatively complex, and this README
is designed to help future contributors understand it's implementation.

## Interface

The telemetry client exposes the `Client` interface. This and its various arguments
and return types are the only public facing part of the client. This is interface
is a composition of the following interfaces:

1. `ChannelClient`: Used for resolving information about a channel from its key.
2. `ReadClient`: Used for reading data from one or more channels across a specified
   time range.
3. `StreamClient`: Used for streaming live data from one or more channels.

Notice that the `Client` interface does not expose any methods for writing data to
the Synnax cluster. The client is only focused on serving and caching reads. Implentations for writing data are defined through the `controller` module

## Internal Components

The client has five main components:

1. `Core`: The central implementation of the `Client` interfaces, which composes the
other components in the module.
2. `Proxy`: A client implementation that wraps another client (right now always the `Core`) and allows for the client to be swapped out at runtime.
3. `Cache`: Held in the `cache` submodule, this is an 
in-memory cache that manages the caching of both historical and real-time data from the Synnax cluster.
4. `Reader`: The `Reader` is responsible for reading historical data from the Synnax cluster, and populating the cache with the data.
5. `Streamer`: The `Streamer` is responsible for streaming real-time data from the Synnax cluster, and populating the cache with the data.
