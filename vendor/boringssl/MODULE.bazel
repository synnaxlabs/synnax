# DO NOT run bazel commands inside this directory. This module exists only as a
# local_path_override target for the root workspace, redirecting all transitive
# boringssl references to openssl. Ideally we would not have to deal with this at all,
# but cpp-httplib automatically pulls in boringssl, which causes name conflicts when
# also including openssl, so we need to override the boringssl reference to openssl.
