/**
 * @brief A utility class that executes a function when it goes out of scope.
 *
 * The defer class provides a mechanism similar to Go's defer statement, allowing
 * for cleanup code to be specified at the beginning of a scope but executed when
 * the scope is exited, regardless of how the scope is exited (normal execution,
 * return, or exception).
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * {
 *     auto resource = acquire_resource();
 *     x::defer d([&resource]() { release_resource(resource); });
 *
 *     // Use resource...
 *     // When scope ends, release_resource will be called automatically
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that this function CANNOT be used to modify return values.
