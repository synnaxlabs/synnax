// Package kv defines a general interface for a key-value store that provides support
// for get/set/delete operations as well as basic read-iteration. This package should
// be used as a boundary for separating an application from a specific storage implementation.
//
// It also provides additional utilities that leverage these interfaces to extend a key-value
// store's functionality.
