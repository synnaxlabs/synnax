// Package confluence implements a generic, template based component framework for
// building concurrent value passing programs. Confluence is built around two core
// types: Value and Segment.
//
// A Value can is any piece of data that can be passed through
// a go channel. Because channels are typically mutex locked, values should generally
// be exchanged as batches of data as opposed to individual entities (i.e.
// pass []int as the as opposed to int).
//
// A Segment is an entity that processes values. A Segment is typically
// a goroutine that reads values from an input channel, does some operation on them
// (sum, avg, IO write, network write, etc.), and passes a result to an output channel.
// This is not to say that the functionality of a Segment cannot extend beyond a
// simple transformation.
//
// For example, a Segment can route values from a set of inputs (called Outlets) to
// a set of outputs (called Inlets). The input-Outlet, outlet-Inlet naming convention
// might seem strange at first, but the general idea is that an Outlet is the end of a
// stream that emits values (i.e. <-chan Value) and an Inlet is a stream that receives
// values (i.e. chan<- Value). Inlets and Outlets are also addressable, which allows you
// to send messages to segments with different addresses based on some criteria.
//
// Collections of segments also be composed into a pipeline using the plumber
// package's plumber.Pipeline. The Pipeline type is itself a Segment that can be
// connected to other Segments. This allows for a flexible and powerful
// composition capabilities.
//
// The confluence package provides a number of built-in Frame that can be used
// by themselves or embedded into custom Segment(sink) that provide functionality specific
// to your use case.
//
// A Segment is a composition of three interfaces:
//
//  1. Flow - Flow.Flow method is used to start any and all operations (goroutines,
//     network pipes, etc.) used by a Segment. The context provided to Flow should be
//     used to stop operations and clear process resources.
//
//  2. Source - A Source is the part of the Segment that can send values to output
//     streams (Inlet(sink)). Inlets(sink) are bound to the Sink (and therefore Segment)
//     by calling the ApplySink.OutTo(inlets ...Inlet[ValueType]) method.
//
//  3. Sink - A Sink is the part of the Segment that can receive values.
//     Input streams (Outlet(sink)). Outlet(sink) are bound to the Sink (and therefore Segment)
//     by calling the Sink.InFrom(outlets ...Outlet[ValueType]) method.
//
// All of this flexibility comes at the cost of needing to follow a few important rules
// and principles when writing programs based on confluence:
//
//  1. All input streams (Outlets) must be bound to a Segment by using
//     the InFrom() method.
//
//  2. All output streams (Inlets) must be bound to a Segment by using
//     the OutTo() method.
//
//  3. The only way to start a Segment is by calling the Flow.Flow method. A single
//     instance of a Segment (if passed as a pointer) should generally only be running
//     once at a time. This is not to say that Segments shouldn't be restarted. This
//     rule is more of a guideline, and can be broken when you know what you're doing.
//
// Related packages:
//
//  1. freightfluence - implements transport for writing Segment(sink) that
//     interact with a network freighter.
//
//  2. plumber - components for connecting Segment(sink) together and routing
//     streams between them.
