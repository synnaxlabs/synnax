// Alignment is two array index values that can be used to represent
// the location of a sample within an array of arrays. For example, if you have two arrays
// that have 50 elements each, and you want the 15th element of the second array, you would
// use NewAlignment(1, 15). The first index is called the 'domain index' and the second
// index is called the 'sample index'. The domain index is the index of the array, and the
// sample index is the index of the sample within that array.
//
// You may think a better design is to just use a single number that overflows the arrays
// before it, i.e., the value of our previous example would be 50 + 14 = 64. However, this
// requires us to know the size of all arrays, which is not always possible.
//
// While not as meaningful as a single number, Alignment is a uint64 that guarantees
// that a larger value is, in fact, 'positionally' after a smaller value. This is useful
// for ordering samples correctly.
