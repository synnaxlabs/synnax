// Additionally, it "snaps" the time stamp to the nearest previous sample + 1.
// calculateOffset returns the calculated offset, the "snapped" time stamp, and any errors.
//
// **THIS METHOD SHOULD NOT BE CALLED BY UNARY!** It should only be passed as a closure
// to domain.Delete.
//
// The logic here is complicated due to the four possible cases with regard to the
// distance approximation:
//
//   - Case 1: Start of domain is exact, target ts is exact
//     This is the simplest case: the distance approximation is exact, and the
//     target timestamp does not need to be snapped to the nearest sample.
//
//   - Case 2: Start of domain is exact, target ts is inexact
//     This case is also simple: we want to delete as little as possible, so we use
//     the upper distance approximation as the distance offset and use the previous
//     sample as the end of the previous domain. For example, if the index looks
//     like: 1 3 5 7 9, the domain starts at 1, and the target is 8, we would use
//     the upper offset (4) and treat 9 as the first sample to delete, while using
//     the timestamp of the previous sample as the end of the previous domain, i.e.
//     7 * Second + 1.
//
//   - Case 3: Start of domain is inexact, target is exact
//     This case happens thanks to index cutoffs, which makes it possible that the
//     start timestamp of a domain is not an actual sample in the domain. In this
//     case, we would use the lower distance approximation instead. For example:
//     if the index is 11 13 15 17 19, but the domain starts at 9 * Second + 1,
//     the start of the domain is inexact. With a target of 17, we would use the
//     lower offset 3 as the delete offset, and use the lower timestamp approximation
//     of 15 * Second + 1.
//
//   - Case 4: Start of domain is inexact, target is inexact
//     Again use the example of 11 13 15 17 19 with the domain starting at
//     9 * Second + 1. If the target is 16, then the offset approximation is
//     (Lower: 2, Upper: 4). However, the actual offset we want is 3, therefore,
//     we must compute (Lower + Upper) / 2. As for the timestamp, we still use the
//     upper approximation for timestamp, i.e. 15 * Second + 1.
//
//     Note the edge case here: if the target timestamp is before the first sample, then
//     the offset approximation is (-1, 1), which results in an error when we stamp with
//     offset-1. Therefore, in this case, we mark the offset to 0 and do not try
//     to snap to a timestamp.
