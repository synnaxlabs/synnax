	// Distance calculates an approximate distance (arithmetic difference in offset)
	// between the start and end timestamps of the given time range. If continuous is
	// true, the index will return an error if the underlying telemetry has
	// discontinuities across the time range.
	//
	// The distance is approximated using a lower and upper bound. The underlying time
	// series can be viewed as a contiguous slice of timestamps, where each timestamp
	// exists at a specific index (i.e. slice[x]). The lower bound of the distance is
	// the index of the timestamp less than or equal to the end timestamp and
	// the index of the timestamp greater than or equal to the start timestamp. The upper
	// bound is calculated using the opposite approach (i.e. finding the index of the
	// timestamp greater than or equal to the end timestamp and the index of the
	// timestamp less than or equal to the start timestamp). Naturally, a time range
	// whose start timestamp and end timestamps are both known will have an equal lower
	// and upper bound.
	//
	// The distance method also returns an alignment pair, which represents the
	// alignment of the lower and upper bounds. The alignment pair is a 64-bit integer
	// where the lower 32 bits represent the domain and the upper 32 bits represent the
	// sample index within the domain.

	// in the number of samples. This operation may be understood as the
	// opposite of Distance.
	// Stamp assumes the caller is aware of discontinuities in the underlying time
	// series, and will calculate the ending timestamp even across discontinuous ranges.
