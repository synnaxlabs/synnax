	//
	// The distance is approximated using a lower and upper bound. The underlying time
	// series can be viewed as a contiguous slice of timestamps, where each timestamp
	// exists at a specific index (i.e. slice[x]). The lower bound of the distance is
	// the index of the timestamp less than or equal to the end timestamp and
	// the index of the timestamp greater than or equal to the start timestamp. The upper
	// bound is calculated using the opposite approach (i.e. finding the index of the
	// timestamp greater than or equal to the end timestamp and the index of the
	// timestamp less than or equal to the start timestamp). Naturally, a time range
	// whose start timestamp and end timestamps are both known will have an equal lower
	// and upper bound.
	//
	// The distance method also returns an alignment pair, which represents the
	// alignment of the lower and upper bounds. The alignment pair is a 64-bit integer
	// where the lower 32 bits represent the domain and the upper 32 bits represent the
	// sample index within the domain.
