# Arc Language Support for VSCode

This extension provides language support for the Arc programming language, including syntax highlighting, code completion, hover information, and error diagnostics.

## Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Full syntax highlighting for Arc language constructs
- **Code Completion**: Context-aware code completion for keywords, types, and built-in functions
- **Hover Information**: Documentation on hover for language elements
- **Error Diagnostics**: Real-time syntax error reporting
- **Auto-formatting**: Automatic code formatting (coming soon)
- **Go to Definition**: Navigate to function and variable definitions (coming soon)

## Requirements

The Arc Language Server (`arc-lsp`) must be installed and available in your PATH, or you can configure the path in the extension settings.

### Building the Language Server

```bash
cd arc/lsp
go build -o arc-lsp
```

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `arc.lsp.path`: Path to the Arc LSP executable (default: `arc-lsp`)
* `arc.lsp.debug`: Enable debug logging for the Arc LSP (default: `false`)
* `arc.lsp.logFile`: Path to the LSP log file, empty for stderr (default: `""`)
