// Package scheduler orchestrates the execution of arc runtime nodes.
//
// The scheduler is responsible for executing nodes in topological order based on
// their dependency graph. It implements a reactive execution model where nodes are
// executed when they or their inputs change. The execution order is determined by
// strata (layers), where each stratum contains nodes at the same topological level.
//
// Execution flow:
//   - Init: Called once for stratum-0 (source) nodes during initialization
//   - Next: Called each cycle for stratum-0 nodes and any nodes marked as changed
//   - Change propagation: When a node's output changes, downstream nodes are marked
//     for execution in the next cycle
//
// The scheduler uses a "changed set" to track which nodes need execution, ensuring
// efficient incremental computation by only running nodes affected by changes.
