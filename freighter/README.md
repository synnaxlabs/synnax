# Freighter

Freighter defines a protocol agnostic transport interface that allows libraries in a
variety of languages to communicate without needing to know protocol, routing, or
encoding details.

It's interface is similar to [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), but it can be implemented by
HTTP, WebSockets, WebRTC, UDP, TCP, etc. For more information on its design, see the
[Freighter RFC](/docs/tech/rfc/0006-220809-freighter.md).

The implementations for specific languages are contained in subdirectories of this
directory.
