# Freighter Python Implementation

This is the Python implementation of the Freighter interface. It currently has
unary implementations in HTTP and a streaming implementation using WebSockets.

## Developing

Freighter uses Python 3.11 and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency
management. To install Poetry and the freighter dependencies, run:

```
pip install poetry && poetry install
```

Then, to spawn a shell into the virtual environment, run:

```
poetry shell
```

## Testing

Unit tests are held in the `tests` directory. To run the test suite, you need a
running instance of the freighter integration server, which lives in the `integration`
directory of the `freighter` project. See the `README.md` in that directory for
instructions on how to run the integration server.

One that's down, spawn a shell into the virtual environment (see above) and then run:

```
pytest
```
