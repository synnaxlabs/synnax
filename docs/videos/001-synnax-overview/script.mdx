Hey everyone, my name is Emiliano, and I'm one of the founders of Synnax. Over the
course of the next few videos, I'll be walking you through all the steps you need to
productively instrument and operate hardware using our platform.

For this first video, I'll be giving you a high-level overview of what Synnax is, how it
works, and why it's different from other solutions out there.

Synnax is software that helps engineering and industrial operations teams instrument,
control, and understand the behavior of hardware systems. Synnax applies in two
scenarios:

1. Test and measurement: If you're developing new engineering components, Synnax can
   help you operate, collect, and review data from them. Some of the common use cases
   include rocket engine firing, structural evaluation, and semiconductor testing.

2. Industrial control: Synnax can help you operate and monitor industrial processes.
   Things like assembly lines, oil and gas pipelines, and energy production.
