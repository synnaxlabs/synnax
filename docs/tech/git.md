# The Synnax Git Workflow in three instructions.

1. Branch names are tied to github/linear issues. The name of your branch should be
   prefixed by the issue it belongs to i.e. `sy-175-line-plot-rules`. For long issue
   names, try to think a short, descriptive name that captures the essence of the issue.
2. Branches are, with few exceptions, always checked out from `main`. Branches are also,
   with few exceptions, always merged into `main`.
3. Never merge your own branch. Always open a pull request to `main` on github and
   request review.
