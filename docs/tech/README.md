# Synnax - Technical Documentation

# 0 - Introduction

Synnax implements a platform for distributed data acquisition, storage and analysis.
It's a complex project with many moving parts. The document guides developers through
the resources available to them, to provide a rational approach for working with the
Synnax codebase.

# 1 - Purpose

The purpose of this document, and the entire `docs/tech` directory, is to:

1. Characterise the core elements that make up the platform, and how they work together
   to provide a cohesive solution. Note that this information is high-level, and
   **deeper explanations are provided in directories related to specific components.**
2. Provide a guide for **navigating the codebase**, and to explain the rationale behind
   the design decisions made.
3. Establish **clear standards on the quality of code we expect**, and to provide references
   to make it easier to adhere to these standards.
4. Put in place the **software engineering foundations** required to work on a project
   with this level of complexity, and to provide a reference for developing these
   foundations.

# 2 - Concepts

The first step to working with the Synnax platform is to understand the high level
components that make up the system. The best way to do this is to read the
[concepts](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/concepts/overview?) section of the official
documentation.

# 2 - Architecture

Next, it's important to understand the architecture of the platform. This is covered
in the [architecture](architecture.md) document.

# 4 - Standards
