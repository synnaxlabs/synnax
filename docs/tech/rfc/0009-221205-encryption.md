# 0 - Summary

In this RFC I propose an architecture for encrypting both intra cluster and client
facing communication. As Synnax uses a variety of transport protocols, with the aim of
supporting new protocols in the future, we need a solution that is as transport agnostic
as possible. Although out of scope for this RFC, we also need to consider encryption as
a mechanism for authentication between members of the cluster.

This RFC starts off with a summary of the different properties we need from an
encryption mechanism, and then goes on to discuss the different protocols Synnax uses
(any may use in the future) and how they implement encryption. This is followed by an
analysis of the ways existing distributed systems implement encryption (CockroachDB,
etcd, Consul, etc.), how they compare to the Synnax use case, and what useful
characteristics we can adopt. Finally, this RFC proposes a baseline design and
implementation for encrypting cluster communications.

# 1 - Vocabulary

- **Node** - A machine in the cluster.
- **Cluster** - A group of nodes that can communicate with each other.
- **Gateway** - The node that receives incoming client requests, and forwards them to
  the appropriate node.
- **Peer** - A node that receives requests from a gateway, and executes them.

# 2 - Motivation

The motivation here is relatively straightforward, although the impetus for implementing
encryption at this stage is not. Encryption was not an initial requirement for the MVP
version of Synnax, but there are a few key reasons why we need to implement it now.
Primarily, the data flowing through the cluster can be sensitive and ITAR controlled,
meaning potential information leaks are a serious concern. Second, and more practically,
the Windows build of the current user interface doesn't allow for making unencrypted
HTTP requests, which means our Windows users can't use the Synnax UI. This is most of
our potential customers, so we need to fix this issue ASAP.

# 3 - Requirements

# 3.0 - Transport Agnostic

Synnax currently uses HTTP and gRPC for communication, with the possibility of using
protocols like WebRTC in the future. We need an encryption design that can easily expand
to support new protocols, and doesn't require extensive changes to the existing
codebase.

# 3.1 - Easy to Configure

Configuring encryption for distributed compute clusters is notoriously, tedious, complex
and difficult. We should aim to minimize the difficulty of provisioning the appropriate
security mechanisms and credentials to enable encryption.

# 3.3 - Implementing Security Best Practices

We should implement encryption in a way that follows best practices for securing
distributed systems.

# 3.4 - Support for Insecure Mode

It should be possible to run a cluster in insecure mode without encryption. This is to
allow for easier development and testing, and to allow for the possibility of running a
secure cluster by using other mechanisms (e.g. a VPN).

# 3.5 - A Tale of One Port

Simplicity is king, and right now we're able to support both HTTP and gRPC on the same
port. We should aim to keep it that way.

# 3.6 - (Eventually) Authentication

Although out of scope for this RFC, using encryption keys as a mechanism for
authentication is a must for running in tightly controlled production scenarios. The
initial design should be set up to allow for this in the future.

# 3.7 - (Eventually) Encryption at Rest

Encryption is largely focused on the transport layer, but applications that can hold
particularly sensitive data (such as Synnax) should eventually support encryption at
rest. This means that are encryption providers need to extend beyond the transport areas
of the codebase, and allow other services to access them.

# 3.8 - (Eventually) Key Rotation

Certificate rotation is common, if not essential for secure systems. Unfortunately, key
rotation compounds the complexity of configuring a security system. The initial design
of Synnax's encryption system should keep eventual certificate rotation in mind.

# 3.9 - (Eventually) Support for Key Distribution Centers and Central Secret Stores

Although not a requirement for the initial design, key distribution centers such as
Hashicorp Vault and central secret stores such as AWS Secrets Manager are common in
production environments. The initial design should be flexible enough to enable support
for these in the future.

# 4 - Transport Protocols

# 4.0 - HTTP

Synnax Server uses [Fiber](docs.gofiber.io) as its HTTP server. Fiber implements TLS
encryption using the standard `*tls.Config` provided by the Go standard library, and
accepts a `net.Listener` as its input. This means we can provide any secured
`net.Listener` to Fiber, and it will use it to serve HTTP(S) requests. In terms of key
rotation, `*tls.Config`supports certificate rotation by providing a `GetCertificate`
function, which can be used to dynamically provide a certificate based on the client's
SNI. The same method can be used for enabling mutual TLS authentication. CA rotation is
also supported by specifying a `VerifyConnection` handler along with a
`VerifyPeerCertificate` handler for enabling mutual TLS authentication.

# 4.1 - gRPC

The gRPC TLS implementation is more confusing that its HTTP counterpart. The gRPC server
can be passed a `*tls.Config` through the options in its credentials package, but it
also accepts a `net.Listener` as its input. It's unclear whether the optimal approach is
to provide a `net.Listener` that wraps a `*tls.Config`, or to provide a `*tls.Config` to
the gRPC server. From reading the gRPC source code, it seems like the former is the
intended approach.

# 5 - Existing Solutions

# 5.0 - CockroachDB

# 5.0.0 - `cockroach cert`

CockroachDB provides a
[command line tool](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/cockroach-cert.html) for
generating self-signed CAs, certificates, and keys, which can be used to easily secure a
cluster. This is a great tool for getting started, and I'd love to incorporate something
similar into Synnax.

# 5.0.1 - A Tale of Two Ports

CockroachDB uses one port for HTTP and a separate port gRPC and PGWire. The reason is
that gRPC behaves differently than most HTTP clients: "where most clients wait for an
acknowledgement from the server before sending headers, gRPC does not."

# 6 - The Ideal Solution

## 6.0 - HTTP/HTTPS/gRPC and mTLS over a Single Port

The initial design takes an unorthodox approach to securing HTTP, HTTPS, and gRPC over a
single port, while incorporating mTLS _only_ for intra-cluster mTLS authentication. The
design uses several layers of connection multiplexing along with a set of custom gRPC
transport credentials and per-rpc middleware to achieve this.

### 6.0.0 - Insecure Mode

The server configuration in insecure mode is straightforward:

<p align="middle">
    <img src="img/0009-221205-encryption/mux-insecure.png" width="50%" />
    <h6 align="middle">Retrieve Query Pipe</h6>
</p>

1. The incoming connection is passed to a root multiplexer (provided by Cockroach Labs
   wonderful fork of [cmux](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cmux)), which matches
   against:

2. HTTP/1.1 requests, which are passed to the HTTP server.

3. All other requests, which are passed to the gRPC server.

It's then the GRPC and HTTP APIs responsibility to handle the request (including any
authentication).

### 6.0.1 - Secure Mode

The server configuration in secure mode is more complicated, and requires a two layer
multiplex along with some creative custom middleware and transport credentials.

<p align="middle">
    <img src="img/0009-221205-encryption/mux-secure.png" width="50%" />
    <h6 align="middle">Retrieve Query Pipe</h6>
</p>

1. Just like in insecure mode, the incoming connection is passed to a root multiplexer,
   which matches against:

2. HTTP/1.1 requests, which are passed to an insecure HTTP server that redirects all
   requests to HTTPS.

3. All other requests are passed to a second multiplexer which performs the TLS
   handshake using [`tls.NewListener`](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#NewListener).
   After the handshake completes, the same matching process as in insecure mode is
   performed:

4. HTTP/1.1 requests, which are passed to the HTTP server.

5. All other requests, which are passed to the gRPC server.

While a bit complex, this is all fine and dandy. The problem comes when we want to
implement mTLS authentication for intra cluster RPCs. We want consumers of the Synnax
API to be able to interact with a secure cluster using password and token based
authentication. If we configure our TLS in the secure multiplexer to require and verify
client certificates, we end up enabling mTLS for gRPC, but not all HTTP requests also
need to use mTLS. This means that we need to be able to selectively enable mTLS for
gRPC, but not for HTTP.

The trick here lies in allowing the TLS multiplexer to verify the client certificate
_if_ it's provided, but not require it. Then, our HTTP server can proceed as normal
without mTLS. We now move the responsibility of validating that the certificate
verification was performed to the gRPC server. This is a two-step process:

### 6.0.2 - gRPC mTLS

Go's gRPC implementation allows a caller to inspect the underlying connections
authentication info by using the `peer.FromContext` function. This function returns a
`peer.Peer` struct with an `AuthInfo` field that contains the authentication info. We
can inspect the contents of this field in per RPC middleware to ensure that the client
was authenticated using mTLS.

This auth info is populated by the `TransportCredentials` passed to the gRPC server on
initialization. When running a standalone gRPC server in secure mode, we would typically
use `credentials.NewTLS` option that generates this auth info for us.

However, our multiplexed server performs the TLS handshake before passing the connection
to the gRPC server. This means that we don't pass any secure transport credentials to
the server, and would instead use `insecure.NewCredentials` to disable authentication.
The issue is that now our middleware won't receive any auth info, and we won't be able
to validate that the client was authenticated using mTLS.

The solution is to create custom transport credentials that inspect the
`tls.ConnectionState` of the connection handed over by the multiplexer. We can then pass
this auth info to the middleware, and validate that the client was authenticated using
mTLS.

# 7 - The Unfortunate Reality

## 7.0 - The Problem

The fundamental problem with the above solution lies in the Synnax visualization UI,
Delta. Delta uses [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) as its underlying runtime, which uses
WebView2 on Windows and WebKit on macOS and Linux. While both of these runtimes support
TLS, they come with a preloaded set of root CAs and do not support turning off
certificate verification.

So we just use a public CA like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) right? Well,
not quite. Synnax nodes not only need to serve RPCs from other nodes but also **issue**
RPCs to them. Certificates issued by a public CA are only signed for server side use,
and cannot be used to authenticate a client. There are ways around this, but they are
complex and we don't want to force users to jump through hoops just to get started with
a secure cluster.

The other option is to install a self-signed CA on the user's machine. This is also not
ideal, as it means every user would need to go through a complex installation process.

The last option is to switch to an entirely different UI runtime like Electron. This is
definitely an option, but I'd love to keep using Tauri if possible.

So, in summary, we have a few options:

1. Use a public CA to issue certificates for both server and client use, which means we
   can't use a self-signed CA OR authenticate peer RPCs using mTLS.

2. Install a self-signed CA on the user's machine, which adds extra installation work
   and makes it more difficult to get started with a secure cluster.

3. Switch to Electron, which requires quite a bit of work and results in a larger
   binary, slower startup time, and higher memory usage.

## 7.1 - The Temporary Solution

There's an [issue](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4039) tracking the need
for ignoring certificate verification in Tauri. Until this is resolved, we'll use a
certificate issued by a public CA and stick to stick to using a single node cluster for
serving our user's data (as a public CA means we can't authenticate intra cluster RPCs).

Although this sounds like a step backwards, the reality is that most of our users don't
need multi-node clusters at this point. We'll track the progress of the Tauri issue and
revisit this decision once it's resolved.
