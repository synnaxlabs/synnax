```go
package irrelevant

import "github.com/synnaxlabs/aspen/internal/node"

type RackKey uint32

type Rack struct {
    Node     node.Key
    LocalKey uint16
}

type ModuleKey uint64

type Module struct {
    Rack     RackKey
    LocalKey uint16
}

```

# Pipeline Maintenance

# Synnax Writer Potential Errors

1 - unreachable - server is shutting down, keepalive watchdog times out, tpc connection
broken

In this case we start a loop to retry opening the DAQ at a somewhat scaled interval.
