# 0 - Summary

The primitive unit of data transfer in Synnax is an array, which contains a collection
of ordered samples for a channel. Moving telemetry across the cluster and to/from
clients using a primitive binary array leaves a lot to be desired. How do we identify
the channel the array belongs to? What is its data type? How do we align it with other
arrays?

In this RFC I propose an architecture for wrapping primitive arrays with identifying
metadata and organizing them into 'frames' of aligned arrays that streamline the
telemetry transfer process.

**A IMPORTANT NOTE (23-08-09)** -> Since the time of writing this RFC, the term 'Array'
has been changed to 'Series'.

# 1 - Vocabulary

- **Sample** - An arbitrary byte array recorded at a specific point in time.
- **Channel** - A name collection of samples across a time range.
- **Density** - The number of bytes per sample.
- **(Sample/Data) Rate** - The number of samples per second.

# 2 - Array Specification

The current version of Synnax uses a `Segment` type to represent telemetry. A segment
contains a binary data array, a channel key, and a time range. This format has started
to show its limitations. The most obvious issue is that the data type of the array is
unknown. The idea was to find the data type by performing a lookup on a channel in the
aim of removing a few bytes from the segment header. In reality, this most likely has a
negligible impact on performance, as segments typically contain many thousands of
samples or more. On the other hand, the lookups required to find the data type of
segments do end up as a performance bottleneck for short-lived reads.

The lack of a data type field is just a few of the many overlooked issues with the
current segment format. The new `Array` type aims to restructure and improve the segment
format.

## 2.0 - Array Data

The requirements for data stored in an array are simple:

1. Channel-tied - Arrays should contain samples for one and only one channel.
2. Continuous - For an array containing samples for a time range x, the samples in the
   array must represent all values in the channel for that time range.
3. Time-ordered - Relatively obvious.
4. Strongly typed - All data in the array is of the same data type, and the data type
   has a fixed density. There are no plans to support variable data types.

All values are encoded in little-endian byte order, with floating point values following
the IEEE 754 standard.

### 2.0.1 - A warning on null and boolean values

I haven't placed extensive thought into how nulls or boolean values should be handled.
The current demands for Synnax don't require these features, and they seem to be an easy
addition later on.

## 2.1 - Metadata Fields

This section defines the fields that will be correlated with an `Array`. The actual
method for attaching this information is challenging, and is discussed in detail in the
next section.

### 2.1.0 - Channel Key

The key for the channel the array belongs to. The telemetry in an array must belong to
one and only one channel.

### 2.1.1 - Time Range

On optional time range representing the span of time the array occupies. If provided,
the time range represents all values in the channel for that time range i.e. it must be
continuous. Cesium automatically sets this field when reading arrays from the database,
giving the caller a hint as to what time range the array occupies.

### 2.1.2 - Data Type

A string representing the data type of the array. All data types have a fixed density.

## 2.2 - Attaching Metadata

The naive approach to adding metadata is an array header, which contains the time range,
channel key, data type, etc. The problem with this approach lies in maintaining
architectural boundaries between different layers of Synnax. Let's say we were to add a
header field named `key` to the array. What should its data type be? Cesium considers
all channel keys to have a string type, while the distribution layer assigns channel
keys as byte arrays containing identifying information about the channel's lease. Should
we set the key type to `distribution.ChannelKey`? If we do so, our cesium code must be
aware of distribution layer semantics, which is a violation of architectural boundaries.
Our other option would be to define different array types for each layer, and convert
between them. This isn't very dry, and doing complex type conversions whenever we want
to move telemetry between layers is not optimal.

Perhaps the better approach is to define a common array whose metadata can be shared
across layers, and then move our layer-specific metadata somewhere else. This is the
approach taken by Apache Arrow's
[Record](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apache/arrow/go/arrow@v0.0.0-20211112161151-bc219186db40/array#Record).
Instead of storing metadata in the array itself, arrow moves it to a separate `Schema`
type which contains identifying information such as the column name (comparable to
Synnax's channel key) outside the array definition itself.

This solution is nice in terms of maintaining a clean architecture, but it also loosens
the connection between data and metadata. Now we need a supplementary data structure
(like apache arrow's `Record`) that holds information correlating arrays with their
metadata.

The next question to answer is: Should we move all metadata to a separate data
structure, or should we only move some of it? My answer: some. Some array information is
effectively universal, and will never be layer independent. This includes the data type,
density, time range, and (maybe?) alignment information.

In summary, the approach is **to attach universal metadata to the array itself, and move
layer-specific metadata to a separate data structure**.

## 2.3 - Array Definition in Go

```go
package telem

type Array struct {
    // TimeRange is an optional parameter that can be set by the database in order to
    // let the caller know what time range this array occupies.
    TimeRange TimeRange
    // DataType is the data type for the array. Has a fixed density.
    DataType DataType
    // Data is the telemetry for the array. Each sample is encoded according to a format
    // specified in DataType.
    Data []byte
}
```

## 2.4 - Array Alignment

Arrays written by a caller or read from storage can have varying degrees of alignment.
In this context, the term 'alignment' means the degree to which a set of frames share
the same time position and scale. For example, two frames are aligned if they have the
same:

1. Time range.
2. Data rate or index.
3. Number of samples.

When arrays are aligned, all values at an index 'i' share the same timestamp.

# 3 - Frame Specification

## 3.0 - Motivation

As discussed in the previous section, separating layer-specific metadata from the array
requires a supplementary data structure. The 'Frame' type is that data structure. In
many ways, a frame is comparable to a 'Record' in Apache Arrow or a 'DataFrame' in
Pandas. A frame stores channel keys as its column names, and arrays as its column
values. Each channel in a frame can have one or more arrays as its values. By separating
the channel keys from the arrays, we can easily move telemetry between layers without
having to worry about converting between different array types.

Frames also provide two additional benefits:

1. They allow us to group associated arrays together. An iterator can use a frame as its
   value, storing time-aligned arrays for multiple channels.
2. They provide a standardized unit of transport between goroutines, layers, and network
   transports. As opposed to sending a single array across a stream at a time, we can
   send frames containing multiple arrays. We can grow, split and merge these frames as
   needed to handle different performance requirements.

## 3.1 - General Design and Properties

## 3.2 - Specification

## 3.3 - Frame Alignment

Frames have alignments representing the overall alignment of their arrays. Frames can be
unaligned, weakly aligned, or strongly aligned.

### 3.3.0 - Weakly Aligned

A frame is weakly aligned if it meets the time range occupied by all arrays of a
particular channel is the same for all channels. This means that the arrays for a
particular channel can have gaps in time between them. The following is a representation
of a weakly aligned frame:

<p align="middle">
    <img src="img/0010-230104-frame-spec/weakly-aligned.png" width="50%" />
    <h6 align="middle">A simple channel ontology represented as a DAG</h6>
</p>

A few things to note:

1. Channels in weakly aligned frames do not need to share the same rate/index.
2. A frame with a single channel is always weakly aligned.
3. Weakly aligned frames typically appear when querying channels that have different
   rates/indexes.

### 3.3.1 - Strongly Aligned

Strong alignment extends weak alignment by requiring that all channels share the same
rate/index and that there are no gaps in time between arrays. The following is a
representation of a strongly aligned frame:

Strongly aligned frames are natural to interpret, as the values in a particular 'row' in
the frame share the stamp timestamp. Synnax requires that all frames written to database
are strongly aligned (it wouldn't really make sense to write a weakly aligned or
unaligned frame).

### 3.3.2 - Unaligned

An unaligned frame does not meet the requirements of either weak or strong alignment.
Reading unaligned frames occur when the requested channels are continuous during
different periods of the requested time range.

## 3.4 - Frame Orientation

Frames can also have an orientation.

### 3.3.0 - Horizontal Frames

Horizontal frames have a single channel and are strongly aligned. A horizontal frame
typically has a single array (in which case, it's also 'square'), although it can have
multiple arrays if the arrays are continuous in time.

### 3.3.1 - Vertical Frames

Vertical frames are strongly aligned and have one or more channels, but only a single
array per channel. Synnax requires that frames written to the database are vertical.

### 3.3.2 - Square Frames

Square frames are both horizontal and vertical. Only a frame with a single channel and
array can be square.
