# 15 - Change Data Capture

- **Feature Name**: Change Data Capture

# 0 - Summary

In this RFC I propose a design for capturing and communicating changes to a cluster's
data store.

# 1 - Vocabulary

- **Sample** - An arbitrary byte array recorded at a specific point in time. Typically,
  an event or reading of a sensor or actuator.
- **Channel** - A logical collection of samples across a time range. Most often emitted
  by a single source.
- **Virtual** - Not persisted to disk - usually a channel.
- **Free Channel** - A channel that has no leaseholder and is virtual. Non-leased
  virtual channels represent events or signals that can be emitted by any node in the
  cluster.
