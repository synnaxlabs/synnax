This section guides you through reading telemetry from a Synnax cluster to perform analysis.
Guides are available for both Python and TypeScript. If you're interested in quickly
visualiing data, see the [Visualize](/visualize/get-started) section.

## Prerequisites

This section assumes you've already:

1. [Started a Synnax cluster.](/deploy/get-started)
2. [Familiarized yourself with channels.](/concepts/channels)
3. [Acquired data you'd like to analyze.](/acquire/get-started)

import ClientTabs from "@/components/ClientTabs/ClientTabs.astro";
import { PackageManagerTabs } from "@/components/PackageManagerTabs";

### Install the Python Client

The `synnax` client requires Python 3.9 or higher, and can be installed using PyPi.

```bash
pip install synnax
```

### Login to Synnax

Before reading or writing data, you need to login to a Synnax cluster. To interactively
login, simply run:

```
synnax login
```

If successful, you should see the following output:

```
Connection successful!
Saved credentials. You can now use the Synnax Client without having to log in. To connect
the cluster in a Python shell, use the following:

from synnax import Synnax
client = Synnax()
```

### Read and Plot Data

You're now free to read and write data. Take the following example,
where we read data from a temperature sensor and plot it.

```python
from datetime import datetime

import synnax as sy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Instantiate a client
client = sy.Synnax()

# Retrieve a channel containing temperature sensor data and a channel containing
# the timestamps for the readings.
temperature_sensor = client.channels.retrieve("my-temperature-sensor")
time = client.channels.retrieve("time")

# Define the start and end times for the data we want to retrieve.
start, end = datetime(2021, 1, 1), datetime(2021, 1, 2)

# Read the data from the channels.
temperatures = temperature_sensor.read(start, end)
times = time.read(start, end)

# Plot the data.
plt.plot(times, temperatures)
plt.show()
```

### Install the TypeScript

The `@synnaxlabs/client` package can be installed using your package manager of choice.

<PackageManagerTabs client:idle>
<Fragment slot="yarn">
```bash
yarn add @synnaxlabs/client
```
</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="npm">
```bash
npm install @synnaxlabs/client
```
</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm install @synnaxlabs/client
```
</Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>
</Fragment>
</ClientTabs>

### Instantiate a Client

```typescript
import { Synnax } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const client = new Synnax({
    host: "https://10.0.0.18",
    port: 9090,
    username: "synnax",
    password: "seldon",
    secure: true,
});
```

### Read Data

```typescript
// In addition to the imports above
import { TimeStamp } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

// Retrieve a channel containing temperature sensor data and the index channel
// containing its timestamps.
const temperatureSensor = client.channels.retrieve("my-temperature-sensor");
const time = client.channels.retrieve("time");

// Define the start and end times for the data we want to retrieve.
const start = new TimeStamp("2021-01-01");
const end = new TimeStamp("2021-01-02");

// Read the data from the channels.
const temperatures = channel.read(start, end);
const timestamps = time.read(start, end);

// Do something interesting with it!
```
