Synnax is a platform for acquiring, controlling, and analyzing data from hardware
systems. Synnax is ideal in two scenarios:

1. Development and testing of advanced hardware. Examples: aerospace, automotive,
   robotics.
2. Operation and monitoring of industrial processes. Examples: manufacturing, energy,
   oil & gas.

Whether you're a part of a large team with tens of thousands of sensors and actuators,
or an individual working on a personal project, Synnax can help you acquire data from
sensors, control actuators, review data, and iterate faster.
