## Writing Automated Control Sequences

Synnax has support for writing automated control sequences in
[Python](/reference/python-client/get-started) and
[TypeScript](/reference/typescript-client/get-started) through their respective clients.
Using one of these clients, you can write scripts for automated control of hardware and
automated analysis of data. There are example autosequences to explore in our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/control),
but we also have a guide on [writing a control sequence for tank
pressurization](/guides/operations/control-sequence).
