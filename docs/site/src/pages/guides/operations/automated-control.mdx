One of the most powerful tools Synnax has to offer is the ability to easily write
control sequences in Python. These control sequences can be run from a command line to
run both simple and complex sequences. In this guide, we will walk you through writing a
control sequence to pressurize and vent a pressure vessel.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Prerequisites

Before writing a control sequence, you should have done the following:

- Downloaded the [Python client](/reference/python-client/get-started)
- Downloaded and started the [Synnax Core](/reference/core/quick-start)
- Downloaded and started the [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started)

### Running a Simulated Data Acquisition System

For the purpose of this guide, we will use a simulated data acquisition system (DAQ) to
represent the hardware. You can view the
[code](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/blob/main/client/py/examples/control/press/simulated_daq.py)
for this DAQ on Synnax's GitHub repository. This DAQ simulates a pressure vessel that
can be filled and vented using several valves. The DAQ has the following sensors and
actuators:

| Channel                | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `daq_time`             | The current timestamps of the DAQ. This is an [index channel](/reference/concepts/channels#channel-types) for the sensors on the DAQ.                 |
| `sensor_#`             | The channels representing pressure sensors on the pressure vessel.                                                                                    |
| `valve_command_#`      | The channels used to write data to (open/close) a valve.                                                                                              |
| `valve_response_#`     | The channels used to read data from a valve (see if a valve is open or closed).                                                                       |
| `valve_command_time_#` | The index channels used for commanding a valve. Valves need separate index channels than sensors in case the valves are commanded at different times. |

We will be using the following sensors and valves in our control sequence:

| Channel    | Purpose                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `sensor_0` | The current pressure in the pressure vessel.      |
| `valve_0`  | The valve used to pressurize the pressure vessel. |
| `valve_1`  | The valve used to vent the pressure vessel.       |

## Writing the Control Sequence

At the top of your script, make sure to import the Synnax library:

```python
import synnax as sy
```

The next step is to connect to a Synnax Core. This can be done by logging in with
through the [CLI](/reference/python-client/get-started#the-synnax-login-command) or by
[passing the credentials](/reference/python-client/get-started#passing-credentials-directly)
into your script.

After that, we will want to instantiate the Synnax client so we can interact with the
Core:

```python
client = sy.Synnax()
```

We are also going to create channel names to use in our control sequence. These names
were created by the simulated DAQ when the respective channels were created.

```python
PRESS_VALVE = "valve_command_0"
VENT_VALVE = "valve_command_1"
PRESSURE = "sensor_0"
```

Next, you'll need to open up a `Controller`. A `Controller` is used to control hardware
by extending a framework for writing data to channels. `Controller`s have methods such
as `get`, `set`, and `wait_until` that make it easy to interact with channels in a
control sequence. We recommend using a context manager to ensure that the `Controller`
is properly closed when the script is finished.

```python
with client.control.acquire(
    name="Pressurization Sequence",
    write_authorities=[200],
    write=[PRESS_VALVE, VENT_VALVE],
    read=[PRESSURE],
) as controller:
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Write authorities determine which writer is allowed to write to a given channel. Every
  writer in Synnax has an authority between 0 and 255. If two writers are open on the
  same channel, the writer with the higher authority will be able to write but the other
  one will not.
</Note.Note>

Next, lets grab the start timestamp from the control sequence and set a target pressure:

```python
start = sy.TimeStamp.now()

target_pressure = 20 # psi
```

We should also make sure the vent valve is closed by setting a `False` value for its
channel on the controller:

```python
controller[VENT_VALVE] = False
```

Finally, we can open the pressurization valve and wait to reach the target pressure
before closing the valve. We will use the `wait_until` method on the controller to
accomplish this. The `wait_until` method will wait until the first argument is met or a
certain time has elapsed. If we want to wait to stop pressurizing the tank after a
certain time has passed even if we haven't reached out target pressure, we can use the
`timeout` argument:

```python
controller[PRESS_VALVE] = True
controller.wait_until(
    lambda c: c[PRESSURE] > target_pressure,
    timeout = 20 * sy.TimeSpan.Second,
)
controller[PRESS_VALVE] = False
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
    Lambda functions are short, anonymous functions in Python. This lambda function can
    be equivalent to writing a function like this:

    ```python
    def if_pressure_reached(controller):
        return controller[PRESSURE] > target_pressure
    ```

    and then calling it in our code like this:

    ```python
    controller.wait_until(if_pressure_reached, timeout = 20 * sy.TimeSpan.Second)
    ```

    For more information on lambda functions, you can visit our [reference
    page](/reference/control/python/get-started#lambda-expressions) on controllers.

</Note.Note>

We can then depressurize the tank by opening the vent valve:

```python
controller[VENT_VALVE] = True
controller.wait_until(
    lambda c: c[PRESSURE] < 5,
    timeout = 20 * sy.TimeSpan.Second,
)
controller[VENT_VALVE] = False
```

After this, we will create a range to represent the test. We can later use this range to
easily look up this test later:

```python
client.ranges.create(
    name="Pressurization Test",
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(start=start, end=sy.TimeStamp.now()),
)
```

This range is now saved and can be referenced later to view this test.

```python
import synnax as sy
import time

client = sy.Synnax(
    host="localhost",
    port=9090,
    username="synnax",
    password="seldon",
    secure=False,
)

PRESS_VALVE = "valve_command_0"
VENT_VALVE = "valve_command_1"
PRESSURE = "sensor_0"

with client.control.acquire(
    name="Pressurization Sequence",
    write_authorities=[200],
    write=[PRESS_VALVE, VENT_VALVE],
    read=[PRESSURE],
) as controller:
    start = sy.TimeStamp.now()

    target_pressure = 20 # psi

    controller[VENT_VALVE] = False

    controller[PRESS_VALVE] = True
    controller.wait_until(
        lambda c: c[PRESSURE] > target_pressure,
        timeout = 20 * sy.TimeSpan.Second,
    )
    controller[PRESS_VALVE] = False

    time.sleep(3)

    controller[VENT_VALVE] = True
    controller.wait_until(
        lambda c: c[PRESSURE] < 5,
        timeout = 20 * sy.TimeSpan.Second,
    )
    controller[VENT_VALVE] = False

    client.ranges.create(
        name="Pressurization Test",
        time_range=sy.TimeRange(start=start, end=sy.TimeStamp.now()),
    )
```

## Running the Control Sequence

The first step to running the control sequence is to start a
[Core](/reference/core/quick-start). After installing the Core you should run the
following command:

```shell
synnax start --insecure --memory
```

Next, you will want to run the simulated DAQ. You can do this by downloading the
[Python script](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/blob/main/client/py/examples/control/press/simulated_daq.py)
from the Synnax GitHub repository. After downloading the script, run the following
command:

```shell
python simulated_daq.py
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Python can be tricky to get installed and running properly. If you are having
  troubles, please visit our [Python troubleshooting
  guide](/reference/python-client/troubleshooting).
</Note.Note>

Now its, time to open the Synnax Console to set up two visualizations of the tank. After
opening the Console, you can connect to the Core using the same connection parameters in
the Python script.

<Video client:only="react" id="guides/operations/automated-control/connect-cluster" />

Now, we will setup a [schematic](/reference/console/schematics) of our tank and valves:

<Video
  client:only="react"
  controls={true}
  id="guides/operations/automated-control/schematic"
/>

In the schematic, make sure there are the following components:

| Symbol | Channels                                                                 | Purpose                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Value  | Input Channel: `sensor_0`                                                | The current pressure in the tank.      |
| Valve  | State Channel: `valve_response_0`<br/>Command Channel: `valve_command_0` | The valve used to pressurize the tank. |
| Valve  | State Channel: `valve_response_1`<br/>Command Channel: `valve_command_1` | The valve used to vent the tank.       |

Once the schematic is set up, you can enter
[control mode](/reference/console/schematics#control-mode) to manually control the
valves.

<Video client:only="react" id="guides/operations/automated-control/control" />

Now, you can set up a [line plot](/reference/console/line-plots) to view a plot of the
pressure in the tank:

<Video client:only="react" id="guides/operations/automated-control/line-plot" />

Once you finished setting up the line plot, your Console should look like this:

<Image client:only="react" id="guides/operations/automated-control/workspace" />

Now, it's time to run your control sequence. You can do this by running the Python
script from earlier:

```shell
python control_sequence.py
```

You should see this result on the Console:

<Video client:only="react" id="guides/operations/automated-control/control-sequence" />
