This guide walks through how to register multiple users to a Synnax Core and manage
their roles.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Prerequisites

- A [Synnax Core](/reference/core/installation) installed and running on a reachable
  network address.
- The [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started) installed and running.
- (Optional) If you would like to manage users from a script, the
  [Python](/reference/python-client/get-started) or
  [TypeScript](/reference/typescript-client/get-started) clients installed.

## Logging Into a Core

To log into a Core, you need the following information:

- Host: the network address of the machine running the Core. Defaults to `"localhost"`.
- Port: the port the Core is running on. Defaults to `9090`.
- Username: the username of the user to log in as. Defaults to `"synnax"`.
- Password: the password of the user to log in as. Defaults to `"seldon"`.
- Secure: whether the Core was configured with TLS encryption. Defaults to `false`.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  The Core does not need to be running on the same machine as the Console or clients.
  All it takes is for the Core to have a reachable network address. To find the local IP
  address of the machine running the Core, run `(Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily
  IPv4).IPAddress` (Windows) / `hostname -I` (Linux) / `ifconfig getifaddr en0` (macOS).
  Then, when you want to connect to the Core from another machine, you use the specified
  address as the `host` argument instead of `localhost`.
</Note.Note>

### Synnax Console

To log into a Core using the
[Synnax Console](/reference/console/cores#Adding%20a%20New%Core), simply click the
**Connect a Core** button in the top-right corner of the Core Selector and enter your
connection parameters:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/connect" />

### Python Client

There are two ways to log into a Core using the Python client, the
[`synnax login`](/reference/python-client/get-started#The%20Synnax%20Login%20Command)
command or by directly
[passing in your credentials](/reference/python-client/get-started#Passing%20Credentials%20Directly):

```python
import synnax as sy

client = sy.Synnax(
    host="localhost",
    port=9090,
    username="synnax",
    password="seldon",
    secure=False
)
```

### TypeScript Client

To log in with the
[TypeScript client](/reference/typescript-client/get-started#Authenticating%20with%20a%20Core),
you can simply create a new client:

```typescript
import { Synnax } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const client = new Synnax({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 9090,
  username: "synnax",
  password: "seldon",
  secure: false,
});
```

## Registering Users

By default, Synnax Cores have a single root user, whose username is `synnax` and
password is `seldon`. The root user has the Owner role, granting full access to the Core
including the ability to manage users and all other resources.

When registering a new user, you must give them a username, a password, and assign them
a role. The role determines what resources the user can view, edit, or delete. The new
user can log into the Core by passing their new credentials into the login command
instead of the root user's credentials.

New users can be registered in the Synnax Console, or programmatically using the Python
or TypeScript clients.

### Synnax Console

Once you've logged into the Core, you can register new users with the
["Register a User"](/reference/console/users#Registering%20Users) command from the
command palette. The command palette can be opened by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`
(Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS), and also by clicking the search bar in the top
of the screen and typing `>`.

### Python Client

To create a new user with the Python client, you can use the `user.create` method:

```python
client.user.create(
    username="new_user",
    password="password"
)
```

### TypeScript Client

To create a new user with the TypeScript client, you can use the `user.create` method:

```typescript
client.user.create({
  username: "new_user",
  password: "password",
});
```

## Managing User Roles

Synnax uses [role-based access control](/reference/console/users#Built-In%20Roles) to
determine what users can and cannot do. Each user is assigned a role, and the role
grants specific permissions across all resources in the system.

To change a user's role in the Synnax Console, find the user in the Users Toolbar on the
left-hand side of the screen, right-click the user, and select "Assign to role". You can
also drag a user onto a role in the resource tree to quickly reassign them.

## Logging in as a New User

A new user can log into a Core by downloading the Console on their computer, and
connecting to a Core using their username and password.

<Video client:only="react" id="guides/sys-admin/multiple-users/login" controls />

Once logged in, the user's capabilities depend on their assigned role. For example, a
user with the Operator role can control hardware and view resources, but cannot modify
system configuration or create schematics. Any workspaces that users create will be
shown under their name in the Users Toolbar on the left-hand side of the screen.
