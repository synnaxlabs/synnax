This guide walks through how to register multiple users to a Synnax cluster and manage
their permissions.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Prerequisites

- A [Synnax cluster](/reference/core/installation) installed and running on a reachable
  network address.
- The [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started) installed and running.
- (Optional) If you would like to manage users from a script, the
  [Python](/reference/python-client/get-started) or
  [TypeScript](/reference/typescript-client/get-started) clients installed.

## Logging Into a Cluster

To log into a cluster, you need the following information:

- Host: the network address of the machine running the cluster. Defaults to `localhost`.
- Port: the port the cluster is running on. Defaults to `9090`.
- Username: the username of the user to log in as. Defaults to `synnax`.
- Password: the password of the user to log in as. Defaults to `seldon`.
- Secure: whether the cluster was configured with TLS encryption. Defaults to `false`.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  The cluster does not need to be running on the same machine as the console or clients.
  All it takes is for the cluster to have a reachable network address. To find the local
  IP address of the machine running the cluster, run `(Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily
  IPv4).IPAddress` (Windows) / `hostname -I` (Linux) / `ifconfig getifaddr en0` (macOS).
  Then, when you want to connect to the cluster from another machine, you use the
  specified address as the `host` argument instead of `localhost`.
</Note.Note>

### Synnax Console

To log into a cluster using the
[Synnax Console](/reference/console/clusters#Adding%20a%20New%20Cluster), simply click
the **Add Cluster** button in the top right corner of the cluster toolbar and enter your
connection parameters:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/connect" />

### Python Client

There are two ways to log into a cluster using the Python client, the
[`synnax login`](/reference/python-client/get-started#The%20Synnax%20Login%20Command)
command or by directly
[passing in your credentials](/reference/python-client/get-started#Passing%20Credentials%20Directly):

```python
import synnax as sy

client = sy.Synnax(
    host="localhost",
    port=9090,
    username="synnax",
    password="seldon",
    secure=False
)
```

### TypeScript Client

To log in with the
[TypeScript client](/reference/typescript-client/get-started#Authenticating%20with%20a%20Cluster),
you can simply create a new client:

```typescript
import { Synnax } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const client = new Synnax({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 9090,
  username: "synnax",
  password: "seldon",
  secure: false,
});
```

## Registering Users

By default, Synnax clusters have a single root user, whose username is `synnax` and
password is `seldon`. The root user has full access to the cluster, and is granted
permissions to manage, create, and retrieve every single resource available in the
cluster.

When registering a new user, you must give them a username and a password. The new user
can log into your Synnax cluster by passing their new credentials into the login command
instead of the root user's credentials.

New users can be registered in the Synnax Console, or programmatically using the Python
or TypeScript clients.

### Synnax Console

Once you've logged into the cluster, you can register new users with the
["Register a User"](/reference/console/users#Registering%20Users) command from the
command palette. The command palette can be opened by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`
(Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS), and also by clicking the search bar in the top
of the screen and typing `>`.

### Python Client

To create a new user with the Python client, you can use the `user.create` method:

```python
client.user.create(
    username="new_user",
    password="password"
)
```

### TypeScript Client

To create a new user with the TypeScript client, you can use the `user.create` method:

```typescript
client.user.create({
  username: "new_user",
  password: "password",
});
```

## Managing User Permissions

Users can have different [permissions](/reference/console/users#Editing%20Permissions)
in Synnax, which determines what they can and cannot do. Permissions can be managed in
the Synnax Console by finding a user in the resources toolbar on the left-hand side of
the screen, right-clicking a user, and selecting "Edit Permissions".

## Logging in as a New User

A new user can log into a cluster by downloading the console on their computer, and
connecting to a cluster using their username and password.

<Video client:only="react" id="guides/sys-admin/multiple-users/login" controls />

Since the new user does not have permissions to create or edit schematics, they will not
be able to do so from the console. Any workspaces that they create will be shown under
their name in the resources toolbar on the left-hand side of the screen.
