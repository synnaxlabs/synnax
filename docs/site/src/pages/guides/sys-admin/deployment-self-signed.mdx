This guide will walk you through every step of deploying a single-node cluster using
self-signed certificates. We'll assume you have a remote Core with a reachable IP
address (and an optional domain name), and you have a local machine you'd like to use to
connect to the cluster.

## Prerequisites

#### Install the Synnax Node binary

This guide assumes you've installed the Synnax node binary onto the remote machine, and
it's available in your `PATH` via the `synnax` command. For operating system-specific
instructions, see the [installation guide](/reference/core/installation).

#### Install the Synnax Console

This guide assumes you've installed the [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started)
on your local machine. You can find the latest release
[here](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/releases).

## Starting the Node

On the remote machine, start the Synnax node with the following command:

```bash
synnax start -l synnax.example.com:9090 --auto-cert --certs-dir=/usr/local/synnax/certs -d /usr/local/synnax/data
```

This command will start a Synnax node that listens on port `9090`, stores its data in
the `/usr/local/synnax/data` directory, and automatically generates self-signed
certificates in the `/usr/local/synnax/certs` directory.

The host name is important, as it will be the reachable domain authorized by the
self-signed certificate (the common name). If you have a domain name pointing to the
remote machine, you can use that instead of `synnax.example.com`.

If you don't have a domain name, don't use the IP address, as the certificate will not
be valid for an IP address. Instead, stick with `synnax.example.com` or something
similar. We'll configure a local host alias for this domain on the local machine in a
[later step](#configuring-a-local-host-alias).

## Installing the CA Certificate Locally

In order to connect to the secure cluster, you'll need to add the CA certificate to the
trusted store on your local machine. You'll need to do this for any machine you want to
connect to the cluster from. See the operating system specific instructions below:

<Platform.Tabs client:only="react" exclude={["Docker"]}>
<Fragment slot="Linux">

We'll start off by copying the CA certificate from the remote machine to your local
machine. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
scp REMOTE_USER@REMOTE_IP:/usr/local/synnax/certs/ca.crt /tmp/synnax-ca.crt
```

Next, you'll need to add the CA certificate to your local machine's trust store. To do
this, first move the CA certificate to the linux certificate directory:

```bash
sudo cp /tmp/synnax-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/synnax-ca.crt
```

Then, update the certificate store:

```bash
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="macOS">

We'll start off by copying the CA certificate from the remote machine to your local
machine. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
scp REMOTE_USER@REMOTE_IP:/usr/local/synnax/certs/ca.crt /tmp/synnax-ca.crt
```

Next, you'll need to add the CA certificate to your local machine's trust store. You can
do this with the following command:

```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /tmp/synnax-ca.crt
```

</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="Windows">

We'll start off by copying the CA certificate from the remote machine to your local
machine. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
scp REMOTE_USER@REMOTE_IP:/usr/local/synnax/certs/ca.crt C:\Users\LOCAL_USER\Downloads\synnax-ca.crt
```

Next, you'll need to add the CA certificate to your local machine's trust store. You can
do that by running the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Import-Certificate -FilePath C:\Users\LOCAL_USER\Downloads\synnax-ca.crt -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Root
```

## Configuring a Local Host Alias

If you don't have a domain name pointing to the remote machine, you'll need to configure
an alias on your local machine that maps the IP address of the remote machine to the
host name you used when starting the Synnax node. This is necessary because the CA
certificate you installed on your local machine will only be valid for the host name you
used when generating it.

To do this, follow the operating system specific instructions below:

<Platform.Tabs client:only="react" exclude={["Docker"]}>
<Fragment slot="Linux">
You can add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file that maps the IP address of the remote
machine to the host name you used when starting the Synnax node. You can do this with the
following command:

```bash
echo "REMOTE_IP synnax.example.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="macOS">
You can add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file that maps the IP address of the remote
machine to the host name you used when starting the Synnax node. You can do this with the
following command:

```bash
echo "REMOTE_IP synnax.example.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="Windows">
You can add an entry to your `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file that maps the
IP address of the remote machine to the host name you used when starting the Synnax node.
You can do this by opening the file in a text editor with administrator privileges and
adding the following line:

```
REMOTE_IP synnax.example.com
```

</Platform.Tabs>
