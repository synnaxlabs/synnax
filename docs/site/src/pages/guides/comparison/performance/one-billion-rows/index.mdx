In this article we'll compare the performance of Synnax to two other leading
time-series databases: [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) and
[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/index/).

Performance is one of many factors to consider when evaluating the time-series
database for your use case: scalability, reliability, and query language are also important
to consider. Synnax, Timescale, and Influx all have their strengths and weaknesses. This
article is the first in a larger series comparing Synnax to other software tools.

We'll start off with a high-level overview of the three databases, explaining their
architecture and ideal use cases. We'll briefly overview our test methodology and setup,
and then dive into the results.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Database Overviews

Timescale, Influx, and Synnax are all designed to store and query time-series data, but
the authors had different workloads and feature priorities in mind when building them.

### Synnax

[Synnax](https://synnaxlabs.com) is specifically built for storing and streaming
hardware sensor data. Unlike the other two databases, it is not designed for general
purpose time-series workloads, such as user analytics, log data, or financial tracking.

#### Data Model

It follows a [channel](/reference/concepts/overview) based data model, where every sensor,
actuator, or data source has its own named bucket of data called a _channel_. Synnax's
query model is much simpler than the the other two databases, and focuses on quality
integration with programming languages through client libraries. It's well suited for
scientific and industrial applications.

Synnax supports real-time streaming of data, much like you would find in a tool like
[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) or a protocol like [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/).
This makes Synnax ideal for industrial applications requiring real-time control,
monitoring, and data processing.

#### Performance Characteristics

The Synnax storage engine, [Cesium](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/cesium),
is designed for high performance and extremely low latency for limited cardinality data. As
we'll show in the results, Synnax dramatically outperforms Timescale and Influx when
ingesting, reading, and streaming large volumes of data from small numbers of sensors
(1 - 10,000 channels at KHz rates).

Synnax performs comparably worse than Timescale and Influx when dealing with large numbers
of sensors (millions of channels) at very low data rates (1Hz or lower).

Synnax is so fast and reliable that teams often use it in high-performance, mission
critical environments such as firing rocket and jet engines.

### Timescale

[TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) is a general-purpose time-series database
built on top of PostgreSQL. Its flexibility allows it to serve a number of workloads
including IoT, user analytics, and financial data.

#### Data Model

Timescale uses a traditional, [relational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model?ref=timescale.com)
data model where each row in a table represents a single event or measurement.

Because it extends Postgres, Timescale integrates well with existing SQL applications
and makes it easy to link metadata with real-time telemetry. The Postgres database
engine is one of the most widely used in the world, and is known for its reliability
across a variety of workloads.

The relational data model is not without its challenges. Timescale requires the user to
understand the scheme of their data before ingestion, and modifying it can be challenging.
Timescale also requires knowledge of SQL to query data, which can be a barrier for
engineering teams that are familiar with scientific analysis tools like Matlab and Numpy.

#### Performance Characteristics

Timescale uses
[hypertables](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/hypertables/) to increase
query performance and reduce storage overhead when compared to Postgres. While a large
step up from vanilla Postgres, Timescale follows a row-based storage model, which
struggles when ingesting and querying data at very high rates.

### Influx

[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com) is a NoSQL time-series database also built for
general purpose time-series workloads. Its primary focus is on ease of use, allowing
users to quickly ingest and query data without needing to define a schema upfront. It
also integrates well with popular analytics tools, such as [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

#### Data Model

InfluxDB uses a [tagset](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud-serverless/write-data/best-practices/schema-design/)
data model. Each measurement has a set of tags, which are key-value pairs that describe
the data. This makes Influx ideal for storing and querying data with many dimensions,
such as user analytics.

## Test Summary

We'll be comparing the performance of Synnax, Timescale, and Influx across three separate
tests that focus on ingestion performance. We'll be running the tests on a single
machine with the following specifications:

<Table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>Processor</b>
    </td>
    <td>12 Core Apple M2 Max</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>Memory</b>
    </td>
    <td>64GB DDR4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>Storage</b>
    </td>
    <td>2TB Apple SSD</td>
  </tr>
</Table>

We'll pull the latest open source versions of each database, which, at the time of writing,
are:

- [Synnax v0.32](/reference/cluster/installation?platform=linux)
- [InfluxDB v2.7.10](https://www.influxdata.com/downloads/)
- [Timescale v2.17.1](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/releases)

### Disclaimer

Performance benchmarks are often controversial, as companies cherry pick workloads
optimized for their database architecture. **We're doing the same here**. Our goal is to
illustrate the scenarios in which Synnax shines: high-speed, low-latency data ingestion
from relatively small numbers of sensors.

That being said, we'll also show where Synnax falls short, and where Timescale and Influx
are better suited. As always, we recommend running your own benchmarks on workloads
suitable to your use case - it's the best way to evaluate the performance of a database.

Inspired by the [1 billion row
challenge](https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/), we'll be inserting
1 billion rows of data into each database to see how they handle the load.

We'll use 50 channels, each with a batch size of 50,000 rows per channel to insert the
data.

## Synnax Architecture

Thoroughly answering these questions requires a collection of articles and supporting
information on database architecture, disk I/O, and the sensor data use case. We'll
summarize two of the most important points here. If you're interested in the details,
take a look at our [technical RFCs](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/docs/tech/rfc).

### <StepText level="h3" name="Reason" step={1}>Individual Files for Each Channel</StepText>

Synnax is much closer to an object storage system than a traditional database. Storage
engines like Timescale (Postgres) rely on a strategy calling _paging_ to organize writes
on disk.

#### Background - Paging, OLTP, and Concurrency Control

Data inside these databases is stored chunks called _pages_ that are between 4kb and
16kb in size. These pages contain a certain number of rows. When accepting writes,
the database engine will fill up a page in-memory, and then flush that
page to disk in a single I/O operation once the page has reached capacity.

Pages are very efficient for databases serving OLTP workloads that have a high degree
of random inserts and/or updates. For high speed ingestion of ordered data (such as
time-series values), pages struggle for a few reasons:

1. **Complex concurrency control** -> When there is high read/write contention over a
   particular page, the database engine must implement complex concurrency control
   mechanisms to ensure data stays consistent.
2. **Copy operations** -> Pages are maintained as in-memory structures, which means that
   incoming writes must be copied from the application to the page. Data within pages
   is frequently moved to maintain order within the page. This results in a large
   number of copy operations.
3. **WAL Files** -> Modern OLTP databases are ACID compliant. The most common way to
   ensure ACID compliance is to use a write-ahead log (WAL). The WAL is a log of all
   the changes to the database. This means that I/O operations are repeated for each
   write.

#### Individual Files for Each Channel - A Seemingly Terrible Idea

Synnax does not use traditional paging strategies. Instead, Synnax maintains an
individual file for each channel in the database. At first glance, this seems like
a terrible idea: For 10,000 channels, we'll need to maintain at least 10,000 files on
disk. When writing to 10,000 channels concurrently, we'll need to perform a
random I/O operation for each one. This is disastrous for performance, especially when
using an HDD.

For the sake of argument, let's assume that disk I/O is not an important factor to
consider (ridiculous, but bear with us). In this case, maintaining 10,000 individual
files has a number of benefits:

1. **Simple concurrency control** -> There is zero contention for writes to different
   channels. This means fewer locks, context switching, copy operations, and other
   overhead associated with ordering data. What about contention for writes to the same
   channel? For sensors, this is almost always a non-issue. Unlike application metrics,
   sensor data almost always arrives from a _single_ source, which means that there is
   limited contention for writes to the same channel.

2. **No WAL Files** -> The file for each channel is already append-only, so there is no
   need for a WAL file.

3. **Extremely fast reads** -> The most common accessed pattern for a sensor-focused
   time-series database is to read a large number of values from a small number of
   channels. Synnax only needs a single, sequential I/O operation to read a continuous
   time range of data for a channel. Since writes are almost always append-only, the
   vast majority of reads do _not_ need to contend with a write operation.

#### Why it's not such a bad idea

When I/O is not a bottleneck, the benefits of individual files are very clear. In our
implementation process, we researched the design of modern object storage systems. S3
is a black box, so instead we read the source code of
[MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio).

As it turns out, MinIO keeps every object in a single file despite the obvious
consequences. Why?

1. **Linux file systems scale surprisingly well** -> File systems such as `EXT4`, `XFS`,
   and `BTRFS` maintain surprisingly fast lookup times for a large number of files.
   MinIO runs nodes with millions of files on a single machine.
2. **Random I/O is not that bad on SSDs** -> As it turns out, the consequences of
   large numbers of random I/O operations are not as bad as one might think. SSDs are
   quite good at random access when occupancy is very high. While a series of
   sequential, random writes is much slower than a single, sequential write, the
   throughput differences drop dramatically with an increase in the number of parallel,
   random write operations.

### <StepText level="h3" name="Reason" step={2}>Zero Copy Hot Path</StepText>

The write performance of a database is fundamentally limited by the speed of the drive
it is connected to (technically this is not true, but it's a fair approximation given
the speed of modern hardware and memory).

This means that the fastest possible write-optimized database is a simple log that asks
the question: _How fast can we slam bytes to disk?_ Modern database engines are very far
from being simple log files, and for good reason. Benefits like ACID compliance, faster
random reads, and other features far outweigh the costs of extra overhead.

Synnax serves a more simple read and write pattern than an OLTP database like
PostgreSQL. As a result, we made optimizations that bring our storage engine
closer to the speed of a simple log file.

Most notably, the vast majority of writes in Synnax require zero in-memory copy
operations from the time they are received over the network until they are written
to disk. This simpler pattern sacrifices complex queries and transaction patterns
like serializable snapshot isolation, although we've found those unnecessary for
the sensor data use case.

## Conclusion

Timescale, Influx, and Synnax all have their strengths and weaknesses. Timescale and
Influx are great for general purpose workloads, and support a larger number of query
patterns.

Synnax, on the other hand, is built for fast reads and writes of time-series sensor
data. If this is the use case you're interested in, we'd love to hear from you. [Contact
