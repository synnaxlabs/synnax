Now that you've set up your first Synnax deployment, it's time to integrate your devices
into Synnax and start collecting data.

## <StepText level="h2" step={1}>Setup</StepText>

We'll be using a National Instruments
[cDAQ-9174](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.cdaq-9174.html) chassis along with an
[NI-9221](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.ni-9221.html) thermocouple card. We'll
also have a thermocouple connected to the card, which we'll collect data from.

Synnax supports any National Instruments device, so if your configuration is different,
this guide will still apply.

When working with NI devices, we need to have the Synnax Driver running on **Windows**
or **Linux**.

### <StepText level="h3" step="1.1">Install the NI-DAQmx Driver</StepText>

Synnax relies on the NI-DAQmx driver to communicate with devices. Before we get started,
we'll need to follow the instructions on the National Instruments
[website](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html).

### <StepText level="h3" step="1.2">Connect the Device</StepText>

Now that DAQmx is installed, we'll plug in the DAQ to our computer running Synnax.
