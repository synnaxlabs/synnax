The first step to getting started with Synnax is to install two key components: the
[Console](/reference/console/get-started) and [Core](/reference/core/quick-start).

<Divider.Divider x />

## Install the Synnax Console

The Synnax Console is our primary user interface for interacting with a Synnax
deployment. We can set up visualizations to observe data, integrate and configure data
acquisition devices, and manually control actuators on our system. Here's the link to
download the latest version of the Console for your OS:

<br />
<br />
<Flex.Box direction="y" justify="center" align="center">
  <Console.DownloadButton client:load />
</Flex.Box>
<br />
<br />

After downloading and running the installer, you'll see a splash screen that looks like
this:

<Image id="console/get-started/window" client:only="react" />

### Plotting Demo Data

To make sure everything is working correctly, we'll plot some live data. Our team has a
demo Core running in the cloud that we can connect to. Head to the Core Selector in the
top-right corner, and select the Core named `Demo`.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/switch" />

You'll see the connection status badge on the right turn blue, indicating that the
connection is healthy.

Next, click on the Workspace Selector in the top-left corner of the screen. This will
open a dropdown menu where we can select the workspace we want to use. Choose the "Demo"
workspace. You'll see the Console automatically re-configure its layout to match the
workspace, and a new plot will appear with a live stream of data.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Installing the Core

Now that the Console is up and running, we'll install our own Synnax Core locally. The
Core is the heart of every Synnax deployment. It's where all sensor and actuator data is
stored, and it serves as a central hub where all of our devices, Consoles, and control
sequences will communicate.

<Fragment slot="Docker">

### Using Docker

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  A Synnax Core within a container has an isolated runtime, which means that it's not
  currently able to access devices attached to the host machine. If you're interested in
  connecting data acquisition devices using the embedded Synnax Driver, we recommend
  installing Synnax directly on the host OS using one of the other installation methods.
</Note.Note>

The simplest way to start a Core is by using the `synnaxlabs/synnax` Docker image:

```bash
docker run -p 9090:9090 synnaxlabs/synnax --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will pull the latest version of Synnax from Docker Hub and start a Core with the
following parameters:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Flag</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`-p 9090:9090`</td>
      <td>Maps port 9090 on the host to port 9090 in the container</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--listen=localhost:9090`</td>
      <td>Sets the address that the Core will listen on</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--mem`</td>
      <td>Store all data in memory (useful for learning and development)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--insecure`</td>
      <td>Run without TLS</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the
[CLI Reference](/reference/core/cli-reference).

To stop the Core, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

<Fragment slot="Linux">

### Using Linux

To start a Core on Linux, first download the latest Synnax binary by running:

<DownloadURL os="linux" />

Then, move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`:

<MoveCommand os="linux" />

Next, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.
  You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</Note.Note>

Finally, start the Core:

```bash
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a Core with the following parameters:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Flag</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`--listen=localhost:9090`</td>
      <td>Sets the address that the Core will listen on</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--mem`</td>
      <td>Store all data in memory (useful for learning and development)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--insecure`</td>
      <td>Run without TLS</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the
[CLI Reference](/reference/core/cli-reference).

To stop the Core, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

<Fragment slot="macOS">

### Using macOS

To start a Core on macOS, first download the latest Synnax binary by running:

<DownloadURL os="macos" />

Next, move the binary to `usr/local/bin`:

<MoveCommand os="macos" />

Then, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.
  You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</Note.Note>

Finally, start the Core:

```bash
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a Core with the following parameters:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Flag</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`--listen=localhost:9090`</td>
      <td>Sets the address that the Core will listen on</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--mem`</td>
      <td>Store all data in memory (useful for learning and development)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--insecure`</td>
      <td>Run without TLS</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the
[CLI Reference](/reference/core/cli-reference).

To stop the Core, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

### Using Windows

To install the Synnax Core on Windows, download and run the latest Synnax installer.

<br />
<br />
<Flex.Box direction="y" justify="center" align="center">
  <WindowsDownloadButton />
  <small>
    Releases for other operating systems and older versions can be found on the
    <a href="https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/releases"> releases page</a>.
  </small>
</Flex.Box>
<br />
<br />

To start the Core, run this:

```powershell
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a Core with the following parameters:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Flag</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`--listen=localhost:9090`</td>
      <td>Sets the address that the Core will listen on</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--mem`</td>
      <td>Store all data in memory (useful for learning and development)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`--insecure`</td>
      <td>Run without TLS</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the
[CLI Reference](/reference/core/cli-reference).

To stop the Core, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

</Fragment>

</Platform.Tabs>

### Connecting the Console to the Core

Now that we have a Core running, we'll disconnect the Console from the demo Core and
connect it to our own. We've pre-populated the Console with a connection for the default
admin user on a local Core. To connect, head to the Core Selector in the top-right
corner of the Console and select the Core named `Local`.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/switch" />

Again, you'll see the connection status badge on the right turn blue, indicating that
the connection is healthy. If you've changed the username or password, or removed the
connection, you'll need to re-add it. Here are the connection details:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Host</th>
    <td>localhost</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Port</th>
    <td>9090</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Username</th>
    <td>synnax</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Password</th>
    <td>seldon</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Secure</th>
    <td>false</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Next Steps

Now that we have a local Core running, it's time to start acquiring data from a device.
Check out the [Synnax Driver](/reference/driver/get-started) to start integrating your
own hardware.
