The first step to getting started with Synnax is to install two key components: the
[Console](/reference/console/get-started) and [Core](/reference/core/quick-start).

<Divider.Divider x />

## Install the Console

The console is our primary user interface for interacting with a Synnax deployment. We
can set up visualizations to observe data, integrate and configure data acquisition
devices, and manually control actuators on our system. Here's the link to download the
latest version of the console for your OS:

<br />
<br />
<Flex.Box direction="y" justify="center" align="center">
  <Console.DownloadButton client:load />
</Flex.Box>
<br />
<br />

After downloading and running the installer, you'll see a splash screen that looks like
this:

<Image id="console/get-started/window" client:only="react" />

### Plotting Demo Data

To make sure everything is working correctly, we'll plot some live data. Our team has a
demo Core running in the cloud that we can connect to. Head to the Core dropdown in the
top-right corner, and select the Core named `Demo`.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/switch" />

You'll see the connection status badge on the right turn blue, indicating that the
connection is healthy.

Next, click on the workspace selector in the top right corner of the screen. This will
open a dropdown menu where we can select the workspace we want to use. Choose the "Demo"
workspace. You'll see the console automatically re-configure its layout to match the
workspace, and a new plot will appear with a live stream of data.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Installing the Core

Now that the Console is up and running, we'll install our own Synnax Core locally. The
Core is the heart of every Synnax deployment. It's where all sensor and actuator data is
stored, and it serves as a central hub where all of our devices, operator consoles, and
control sequences will communicate.

### Using Docker

<Note.Note variant="error">
  A Synnax cluster within a container has an isolated runtime, which means that it's not
  currently able to access devices attached to the host machine. If you're interested in
  connecting data acquisition devices using our built-in drivers, we recommend
  installing Synnax directly on the host OS using one of the other installation methods.
</Note.Note>

The simplest way to start a single node cluster is by using the `synnaxlabs/synnax`
Docker image, simply run:

```bash
docker run -p 9090:9090 synnaxlabs/synnax --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will pull the latest version of Synnax from Docker Hub and start a single node
cluster with the following parameters:

`-p 9090:9090` - This maps port 9090 on the host to port 9090 in the container. This
allows access to the Synnax node from the host machine.

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This is
the reachable adress of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the
[CLI Reference](/reference/core/cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

<Fragment slot="Linux">

### Using Linux

To start a single node cluster on Linux, first download the latest Synnax binary by
running:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="linux" />

Then, move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="linux" />

Next, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.
  You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</Note.Note>

Finally, start the node:

```bash
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This is
the reachable address of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the
[CLI Reference](/reference/core/cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

### Using macOS

To start a single node cluster on macOS, first download the latest Synnax binary by
running:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="macos" />

Next, move the binary to `usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="macos" />

Then, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.
  You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</Note.Note>

Finally, start the node:

```bash
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This is
the reachable adress of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the
[CLI Reference](/reference/core/cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

### Using Windows

To install the Synnax cluster on Windows, download and run the latest Synnax installer.

<br />
<br />
<Flex.Box direction="y" justify="center" align="center">
  <WindowsDownloadButton />
  <small>
    Releases for other operating systems and older versions can be found on the
    <a href="https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/releases"> releases page</a>.
  </small>
</Flex.Box>
<br />
<br />

To start the node, run this:

```powershell
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This is
the reachable address of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the
[CLI Reference](/reference/core/cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

### Connecting the Console to the Cluster

Now that we have a local cluster running, we'll disconnect the console from the demo
cluster and connect it to our own. We've pre-populated the console with a connection for
the default admin user on a local cluster. To connect, head to the cluster dropdown in
the bottom right corner of the console and select the cluster named `Local`.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/switch" />

Again, you'll see the connection status badge on the right turn blue, indicating that
the connection is healthy. If you've changed the username or password, or removed the
connection, you'll need to re-add it. Here are the connection details:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Host</th>
    <td>localhost</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Port</th>
    <td>9090</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Username</th>
    <td>synnax</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Password</th>
    <td>seldon</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Secure</th>
    <td>false</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Next Steps

Now that we have a local cluster running, it's time to start acquiring data from a
device. Check out our [Device Drivers](/reference/device-drivers/get-started) to start
integrating your own hardware.
