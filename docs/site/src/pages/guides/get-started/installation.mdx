The first step to getting started with Synnax is to install two key components:
the [Console](/reference/console/get-started) and [Cluster](/reference/cluster/quick-start).

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Install the Console

The console is our primary user interface for interacting with a Synnax deployment.
We can set up visualizations to observe data, integrate and configure data acquisition
devices, and manually control actuators on our system. Here's the link to download the
latest version of the console for your OS:

<br />
<br />
<Align.Space direction="y" justify="center" align="center">
  <SynnaxConsoleDownloadButton client:load />
</Align.Space>
<br />
<br />

After downloading and running the installer, you'll see a splash screen that looks like this:

<Image id="console/get-started/window" client:only="react" />

### Plotting Demo Data

To make sure everything is working correctly, we'll plot some live data. Our team has
a demo cluster running in the cloud that we can connect to. Head to the cluster
dropdown in the bottom left corner, and select the cluster named `Demo`.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/switch" />

You'll see the connection status badge on the right turn blue, indicating that the
connection is healthy.

Next, click on the workspace selector in the top right corner of the screen. This
will open a dropdown menu where we can select the workspace we want to use. Choose
the "Demo" workspace. You'll see the console automatically re-configure its layout
to match the workspace, and a new plot will appear with a live stream of data.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Installing the Cluster

Now that the Console is up and running, we'll install our own Synnax cluster locally.
The cluster is the core of every Synnax deployment. It's where all sensor and actuator data is stored,
and it serves as a central hub where all of our devices, operator consoles, and control
sequences will communicate.

### Using Docker

<Note.Note variant="error">
  A Synnax cluster within a container has an isolated runtime, which means that it's not
  currently able to access devices attached to the host machine. If you're interested in
  connecting data acquisition devices using our built-in drivers, we recommend
  installing Synnax directly on the host OS using one of the other installation methods.
</Note.Note>

The simplest way to start a single node cluster is by using the
`synnaxlabs/synnax` Docker image, simply run:

```bash
docker run -p 9090:9090 synnaxlabs/synnax --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will pull the latest version of Synnax from Docker Hub and start a single
node cluster with the following parameters:

`-p 9090:9090` - This maps port 9090 on the host to port 9090 in the container.
This allows access to the Synnax node from the host machine.

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on.
This is the reachable adress of the node, and is also the address that other
nodes will use to connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for
learning and development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the [CLI
Reference](/reference/cluster/cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

<Fragment slot="linux">

### Using Linux

To start a single node cluster on Linux, first download the latest Synnax binary
by running:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="linux" />

Then, move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="linux" />

Next, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.
  You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</Note.Note>

Finally, start the node:

```bash
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on.
This is the reachable address of the node, and is also the address that other
nodes will use to connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for
learning and development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the [CLI
Reference](/reference/cluster/cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

### Using macOS

To start a single node cluster on macOS, first download the latest Synnax binary
by running:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="macos" />

Next, move the binary to `usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="macos" />

Then, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.
  You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</Note.Note>

Finally, start the node:

```bash
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on.
This is the reachable adress of the node, and is also the address that other
nodes will use to connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for
learning and development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the [CLI
Reference](/reference/cluster/cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

To start the node, run this:

```powershell
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on.
This is the reachable address of the node, and is also the address that other
nodes will use to connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

### Connecting the Console to the Cluster

Now that we have a local cluster running, we'll disconnect the console from the demo
cluster and connect it to our own. We've pre-populated the console with a connection
for the default admin user on a local cluster. To connect, head to the cluster dropdown
in the bottom right corner of the console and select the cluster named `Local`.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/switch" />

Again, you'll see the connection status badge on the right turn blue, indicating
that the connection is healthy. If you've changed the username or password, or removed
the connection, you'll need to re-add it. Here are the connection details:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Host</th>
    <td>localhost</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Port</th>
    <td>9090</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Username</th>
    <td>synnax</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Password</th>
    <td>seldon</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Secure</th>
    <td>false</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Next Steps

Now that we have a local cluster running, it's time to start acquiring data from a
device. Check out our [Device Drivers](/reference/device-drivers/get-started) to start
integrating your own hardware.
