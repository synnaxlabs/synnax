This page walks you through using [ranges](/concepts/read-ranges) to query sections of
your cluster's data.

## Prerequisites

This page assumes you've already:

-   [Installed the Console](/console/get-started)
-   [Connected to a cluster](/console/connect-a-cluster)

## Defining New Ranges

The primary means for accessing data in the Synnax console is through ranges. A range 
is identified by a start timestamp, end timestamp, and name. You can read more conceptually
about ranges [here](/concepts/read-ranges).

### Local ranges

Local ranges exist only within your console, and are not persisted to the cluster. They're
quite useful for quickly exploring data, and can eventually be converted to persisted
ranges if you so desire. To create a local range, click the "Add Range" button in the
ranges toolbar.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/new-range" />

### Persisted ranges

Persisted ranges are saved permanently to the cluster, and can be accessed by other
members of your organization. Creating a persisted range is the same as creating a 
local range, but you'll click the "Save Permanently" button instead.

### Parameters for creating a range

<Table
    columns={[
        {
            key: "name",
            name: "Name",
            width: 125,
        },
        {
            key: "description",
            name: "Description",
        },
    ]}
    data={[
        {
            name: "Name",
            description: "A human-readable name for identifying the range",
        },
        {
            name: "Start Date",
            description: "The start date of the range.",
        },
        {
            name: "Start Time",
            description:
                "The start time of the range. This value is inclusive, meaning any samples with a timestamp equal to the start time will be included in the range.",
        },
        {
            name: "End Date",
            description: "The end date of the range.",
        },
        {
            name: "End Time",
            description:
                "The end time of the range. This value is exclusive, meaning any samples with a timestamp equal to the end time will not be included in the range.",
        },
    ]}
/>


## Finding Existing Ranges

There are two ways to find existing ranges in the console. The resources tool bar and
the command and search palette.

### Through the resources toolbar

The resources toolbar is located on the left side of the console, and can be used to 
browse all of your cluster's resources, including ranges. All of your ranges can
be found under the "Ranges" section.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/range-resources" style={{width: "50%", marginLeft: "25%"}}/>

We can load a specific range into our ranges table by double clicking on it.

### Through the command and search palette

The command and search palette is located in the top center of the console, and can be
used to search for cluster resources and execute commands. We can find a permanently
saved range just by typing its name into the palette.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ranges-palette" />

Use the arrow keys to navigate the results, and press enter to load the range you're
interested in. You can also hover and click using your mouse.
