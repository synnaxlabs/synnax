export const components = { pre: Code };

The Synnax typescript client supports multiple methods for writing data to a cluster. We
can write directly to a channel, or we can write to multiple channels in a streaming
fashion using a writer.

## Writing to a Channel

### The simplest write - fixed rate

Writing to a fixed rate channel is as simple as calling the channel's `write` method.
We'll create teh following fixed rate channel as an example:

```typescript
import { DataType, Rate } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const myTemperatureSensor = await client.channels.create({
    name: "temperature",
    rate: Rate.hz(5),
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32
});
```

Then, we'll provide our data and a timestamp marking the first sample to the `write`
method:

```typescript
import { TimeStamp } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

// Our temperature data
const data = new Float32Array([20.0, 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4]);

// The timestamp of the first sample. All other samples will be spaced from this
// timestamp according to the channel's rate. In this case, the rate is 5Hz, so
// the samples will be spaced 200ms apart i.e.
// 20.0 @ start + 0ms
// 20.1 @ start + 200ms
// 20.2 @ start + 400ms
// 20.3 @ start + 600ms
// 20.4 @ start + 800ms
const start = TimeStamp.now();

// Write the data
await myTemperatureSensor.write(TimeStamp.now(), data);
```

If we had multiple channels, we would pass the same timestamp to each channel's `write`
method. This would ensure that the data is correctly aligned across all channels.

```typescript
const temperatureData = new Float32Array([20.0, 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4]);
const pressureData = new Float32Array([1000.0, 1000.1, 1000.2, 1000.3, 1000.4]);

const start = TimeStamp.now();

await myTemperatureSensor.write(start, temperatureData);
await myPressureSensor.write(start, pressureData);
```

### Writing to a channel with a variable rate

Writing to a variable rate channel requires us to write to a channel's index before 
we write it's data. We'll create the following index-indexed pair as an example:

```typescript
import { DataType } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const timeChannel = await client.channels.create({
    name: "time",
    dataType: DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    isIndex: true,
});

const temperatureChannel = await client.channels.create({
    name: "temperature",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    index: timeChannel.key
});
```

Then, we'll make sure to write teimstamps to the index before we write data to the
channel:

```typescript

import { TimeStamp, TimeSpan } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const start = TimeStamp.now();
const timestamps = new BigInt64Array([
    start.bigInt,
    start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(1)).bigInt,
    start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(2)).bigInt,
    start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(3)).bigInt,
    start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(4)).bigInt
]);
const temperatures = new Float32Array([20.0, 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4]);

// Write the timestamps to the index first
await timeChannel.write(start, timestamps);
// Then write the data
await temperatureChannel.write(start, temperatures);
```

Notice how we align the two arrays by using the common `start` timestamp. This tells
Synnax that the first sample in the `temperatures`  array is associated with the first
timestamp in the `timestamps` array, and so on.

Synnax will raise a `ValidationError` if the index does not contain a corresponding
timestamp for every sample in the data array. After all, it wouldn't make sense to have
a temperature reading without an associated timestamp.

## Using a Writer

While the above methods are great for writing static, existing data, it's common to want 
to write data in a streaming fashion for use in control sequences and live dashbaords.
The `Writer` class is designed to handle this use case (and is actually used under the hood
by the above methods).

Writers are a bit more complicated to operate, so we recommend reading the [concepts](/concepts/write-domains#transactions) page to learn more about
how they work.

### Opening a Writer

We'll create the following index-indexed pair to use with our writer.

```typescript
import { DataType } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const timeChannel = await client.channels.create({
    name: "time",
    dataType: DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    isIndex: true,
});

const temperatureChannel = await client.channels.create({
    name: "temperature",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    index: timeChannel.key
});
```

Then, we'll open a writer for both of these channels by using the `telem.openWriter`
method on the client.

```typescript
import { TimeStamp, Series, Frame } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const writer = await client.telem.openWriter({
    start: TimeStamp.now(),
    channels: [timeChannel.key, temperatureChannel.key]
});

try {
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        await writer.write(new Frame({
            [timeChannel.key]: TimeStamp.now(),
            [temperatureChannel.key]: 20.0 + i,
        }));
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
    }
    await writer.commit():
} finally {
    await writer.close()
}
```

This example will write 100 samples to the `temperature` channel, each roughly 100ms 
apart, and will commit all writes when finished.

It's typical to write and commit millions of samples over the course of hours or days,
intermittently calling commit to ensure that the data is safely stored in the cluster.

It's very important to free the writer resources when finished by calling the `close`
method. If `close` is not called at the end of the writer, other writers may not 
be able to write to the same channels. We typically recommend placing the writer operations
inside a try-finally block to ensure that the writer is always closed.
