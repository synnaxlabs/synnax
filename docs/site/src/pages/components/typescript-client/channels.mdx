---

The Typescript client provides interfaces for creating, retrieving and reading data from
channels in a Synnax cluster. In this guide, we'll cover the details of each of these 
operations.

If you're unfamiliar with what channels are and how they work, check out the 
of [channels concepts guide](/concepts/channels).

## Creating Channels

To create channels, we can use the `.channels.create` method on the Synnax client.

#### Creating a single, fixed rate channel

The simplest channel to create stores samples at a fixed rate.

```typescript
import { DataType, Rate } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const myTemperatureSensor = client.channels.create({
    name: "my_temperature_sensor",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    rate: Rate.hz(1)
});
```

## Creating an indexed channel and its index

Creating variable rate channels first requires us to create an index channel to store 
timestamps.

```typescript
import { DataType } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const timeIndexChannel = await client.channels.create({
    name: "time",
    dataType: DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    isIndex: true,
});

const myTemperatureSensor = await client.channels.create({
    name: "my_temperature_sensor",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    index: timeIndexChannel.key
});
```

Notice how we set the `isIndex` property to `true` on the time channel. This tells 
Synnax that this channel will be used to store timestamps for other channels. We then
pass the `index` property to the temperature sensor channel to tell Synnax to use the
time channel as its index.

### Creating Multiple Channels

We can also create multiple channels efficiently by providing a list of channels to the
`create` method. This is far more efficient than creating channels individually, and
provides the atomic guarantee that either no or all channels will be created.

<div class="info">
<b>Note</b> - When creating variable rate channels, keep in mind that we need to create
index channels before we can create the channels that use them. 
</div>

```typescript
// We need to create the index first, that way we can provide 
// its key to our data channels.
import { Channel } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const timeIndexChannel = await client.channels.create({
    name: "time",
    dataType: DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    isIndex: true,
});

const sensorOne = new Channel({
    name: "sensor_one",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    index: timeIndexChannel.key
});

const sensorTwo = new Channel({
    name: "sensor_two",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    index: timeIndexChannel.key
});

const sensorThree = new Channel({
    name: "sensor_three",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    index: timeIndexChannel.key
});

const sensors = await client.channels.create([sensorOne, sensorTwo, sensorThree]);
```

## Retrieving Channels

Like creating them, we can retrieve channels using the `channels.retrieve` method on 
the client.

### Retrieving a single channel

To retrieve a single channel, we can pass the channel's name or key to the `retrieve` 
method.

```typescript
// By name
const myTemperatureSensor = await client.channels.retrieve("my_temperature_sensor");
// If you know the key, you can use that too
const myTemperatureSensor = await client.channels.retrieve(myTemperatureSensor.key);
```

If Synnax finds no channels matching the query, the client will raise a `NoResultsError`.
If more than one channel matches the query, the client will raise a `MultipleResultsError`. 
If you'd like to accept no or multiple results, provide a list to the `retrieve` method
as shown in the next section.

### Retrieving multiple channels

We can also retrieve multiple channels by passing a list of names or keys to the 
`retrieve` method.

```typescript
// By name
const channels = await client.channels.retrieve(["my_temperature_sensor", "time"]);
// By key
const channels = await client.channels.retrieve([myTemperatureSensor.key, timeIndexChannel.key]);
// This won't work!!
const channels = await client.channels.retrieve(["my_temperature_sensor", timeIndexChannel.key]);
```

Note that Synnax will not raise a `NoResultsError` if no channels match the query. Instead,
it will simply omit that channel from the list of results.

## Deleting Channels

To delete a channel, we can use the `channels.delete` method on the client.

<div class="info">
<b>Note</b> - Deleting a channel will also delete all of the data stored in that channel.
This is a permanent operation that cannot be undone. Be careful!
</div>

To delete a channel, we can use the `channels.delete` method.

```typescript
# Delete a single channel
await client.channels.delete("my_precise_tc")
# Delete multiple channels
await client.channels.delete(["sensor_one", "sensor_two"])
# Delete by key
await client.channels.delete(sensor_three.key)
# Delete many by key
await client.channels.delete([sensor_one.key, sensor_two.key, sensor_three.key])
```

Unlike with retrieving channels, Synnax will not raise an error if it cannot find a
channel matching the key or name. This means that `delete` is an idempotent operation,
and is safe to call even if the channel has already been deleted.

Deleting a channel by name will delete **all** channels with that name. 

## Next Steps

Now that we know how to create and retrieve channels, we can start reading and writing
data to them. Check out the [reading telemetry](/typescript-client/read-telemetry)
and [writing telemetry](/typescript-client/write-telemetry) guides to learn more.
