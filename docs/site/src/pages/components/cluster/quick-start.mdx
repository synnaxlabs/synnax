This page will walk you through starting a single node Synnax cluster. To get started,
select your operating system below:

        { name: "Linux", tabKey: "linux" },

## Using Docker

The simplest way to start a single node cluster is by using the `synnaxlabs/synnax` Docker image,
simply run:

```cmd
docker run -p 9090:9090 synnaxlabs/synnax --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will pull the latest version of Synnax from Docker Hub and start a single node cluster with
the following parameters:

`-p 9090:9090` - This maps port 9090 on the host to port 9090 in the container. This allows
access to the Synnax node from the host machine.

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This
is the reachable adress of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the [CLI Reference](/components/cluster/cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Using Linux

To start a single node cluster on Linux, first download the latest Synnax binary
by running:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="linux" />

Then, move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="linux" />

Next, give execution permissions to the binary:

```cmd
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<Note variant="info">
<b>Note - </b> You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment
variable. You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</Note>

Finally, start the node:

```cmd
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This
is the reachable address of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the [CLI Reference](/components/cluster/cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Using MacOS

To start a single node cluster on macOS, first download the latest Synnax binary
by running:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="macos" />

Next, move the binary to `usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="macos" />

Then, give execution permissions to the binary:

```cmd
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<Note variant="info">
<b>Note - </b> You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment
variable. You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</Note>

Finally, start the node:

```cmd
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This
is the reachable adress of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the [CLI Reference](/components/cluster/cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

<Fragment slot="windows">

## Using Windows

To start a single node cluster on Windows, use the following script to 
download the latest Synnax binary and move it into your `PATH`:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="windows" />

<Note variant="info">
<b>Note - </b> We recommend adding `;$env:appdata/synnax` to your `PATH` environment variable, which 
will allow you to execute synnax commands from any shell. See [Microsoft's Environment Variable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.4#saving-changes-to-environment-variables)
documentation for more.
</Note>

To start the node, run

```cmd
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This
is the reachable address of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the [CLI Reference](/components/cluster/cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
