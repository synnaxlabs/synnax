Using a systemd service is a great way to manage a Synnax node. Here is an
example service file (typically kept in `/lib/systemd/system/synnax/service`):

```ini
[Unit]
Description = synnax

[Service]
Type = simple
User = synnax
Group = synnax
LimitNOFILE = 4096
Restart = always
RestartSec = 5s
StandardOutput = /home/synnax/synnax.log
StandardError = /home/synnax/errors.log
ExecStart = /home/synnax/synnax --listen="localhost:9090"

[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target
```
