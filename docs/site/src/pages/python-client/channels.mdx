---

The Python client provides interfaces for creating, retrieving, and reading data from
channels. In this guide, we'll cover the details of each of these operations.

If you're unfamiliar with what channels are and how they work, check out the 
[channels concepts guide](/concepts/channels).

## Creating Channels

To create channels, we can use the `channels.create` method on the Synnax client.

### Creating a single, fixed rate channel

The simplest channel to create stores samples at a fixed rate.

```python
# Create a fixed rate thermocouple channel that stores 32-bit floats.
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_tc",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    rate=100 * sy.Rate.HZ,
)
```

### Creating an indexed channel and its index

Creating variable rate channels requires us to first create an index channel to store
timestamps.

```python
# Create a time channel to store the timestamps of our indexed channel
time_index_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="time",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP, # must be a timestamp channel
    is_index=True,
)

# Create an indexed channel that stores 32-bit floats
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_tc",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=time_index_channel.key, # Pass the key of the index channel here.
)
```

### Creating Multiple Channels

We can also create multiple channels by passing a list to the `create` method. This is 
far more efficient than creating many channels individually, and provides the atomic
guarantee that either all or no channels will be created.

<div class="info">
<b>Note</b> - When creating variable rate channels, keep in mind that we need to create 
index channels before we can create the channels that use them. We're working on adding
functionality to the client that will allow us to create all of these channels in a single
call.
</div>

```python
# We need to create the index first, that way we can provide the index 
# key to our data channels.
time_index = client.channels.create(
    name="time",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=True,
)

sensor_one = sy.Channel(
    name="sensor_one",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=time_index.key,
)

sensor_two = sy.Channel(
    name="sensor_two",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT64,
    index=time_index.key,
)

sensor_three = sy.Channel(
    name="sensor_three",
    data_type=sy.DataType.INT8,
    rate=25 * sy.Rate.KHZ,
)

client.channels.create([
    sensor_one,
    sensor_two,
    sensor_three
])
```

### Conditionally creating a channel if it doesn't exist

There are situations where we want to ensure that a channel with a particular
name exists, but don't want to duplicate it if it has already been created. To do 
accomplish this, we can use the `retrieve_if_name_exists` flag.

```python
# Create a channel if it doesn't exist
my_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="my_channel",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    rate=100 * sy.Rate.HZ,
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)
```

## Retrieving Channels

Like creating them, we can retrieve channels using the `channels.retrieve` method.

### Retrieving a single channel

To retrieve a single channel, we can pass the channel's name or key to the `retrieve` 
method.

```python
# By name
my_precise_tc = client.channels.retrieve("my_precise_tc")
# If you know the key, you can also retrieve by key
my_precise_tc = client.channels.retrieve(my_precise_tc.key)
```

If Synnax finds no channels matching the query, the client will raise a `NoResultsError`.
If more than one channel matches the query, the client will raise a `MultipleResultsError`. 
If you'd like to accept no or multiple results, provide a list to the `retrieve` method
as shown in the next section.

### Retrieving multiple channels

We can also retrieve multiple channels by passing a list of names or keys to the
`retrieve` method. 

```python
# By name
my_channels = client.channels.retrieve(["sensor_one", "sensor_two"])
# By key if you know them
my_channels = client.channels.retrieve([sensor_one.key, sensor_two.key])
```

Note that Synnax will not raise a `QueryError` if it cannot find a channel matching a 
key or name. Instead, it will simply omit that channel from the list of results.

### Retrieving a channel using a Range

If you've queried a [range](/analyze/access-ranges), you can access channels as
properties. If the channel name is not a valid Python identifier, you can use the
dictionary accessor (`[]`) instead.

```python
# Retrieve the range - see the highlighted link above for how these work
bike_outing = client.ranges.retrieve("02/22/23 Cycling")

# Grab a channel
ch = bike_outing["sensor_one"]
# Or like this
ch = bike_outing.sensor_one
```

<div class="info">
<b>Note</b> - When using a range, it's possible to retrieve a channel by its alias
instead of its name. For more information, see 
<a href="/python-client/named-ranges#aliasing-channels">aliasing channels</a>.
</div>

### Retrieving channels using regular expressions

If you're familiar with regular expressions, you can use them to retrieve channels
that match a pattern. For example, if we wanted to retrieve all channels that start
with "sensor", we could do the following:

```python
sensor_channels = client.channels.retrieve(["^sensor"])
```

It's important to note that if we're expecting multiple channels to match our pattern,
we need to pass in a list to the `retrieve` method, otherwise the client will raise
a `QueryError`.

## Deleting Channels

<div class="info">
<b>Note</b> - Deleting a channel will also delete all of the data stored in that channel.
This is a permanent operation that cannot be undone. Be careful!
</div>

To delete a channel, we can use the `channels.delete` method.

```python
# Delete a single channel
client.channels.delete("my_precise_tc")
# Delete multiple channels
client.channels.delete(["sensor_one", "sensor_two"])
# Delete by key
client.channels.delete(sensor_three.key)
# Delete many by key
client.channels.delete([sensor_one.key, sensor_two.key, sensor_three.key])
```

Unlike with retrieving channels, Synnax will not raise an error if it cannot find a
channel matching the key or name. This means that `delete` is an idempotent operation,
and is safe to call even if the channel has already been deleted.

Deleting a channel by name will delete **all** channels with that name. 

## Next Steps

Now that we know how to create and retrieve channels, we can start reading and writing
data to them. Check out the [reading telemetry](/python-client/read-telemetry) and
[writing telemetry](/python-client/write-telemetry) guides to learn more.
