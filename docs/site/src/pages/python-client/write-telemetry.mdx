Synnax supports multiple methods for writing data to a cluster. We can write directly
to a channel, fetch a named range and set its data, or leverage writers for writing large
volumes of telemetry.

Writes in Synnax are more complicated than reads, and, as such, we recommend checking out
our [concepts](/docs/concepts/write-domains) page to learn more about the best practices
for writing data to Synnax.

## Writing to a Channel

### The simplest write - fixed rate

Writing to a fixed rate channel is as simple as calling the channel's `write` method.
We'll create the following fixed rate channel as an example:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Create the channel
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_tc",
    data_type=np.float32,
    rate=1 * sy.HZ,
)
```

Then, we'll provide our data and a timestamp marking the first sample to the `write` 
method:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Our temperature data. 
temperatures = [55, 55.1, 55.7, 57.2, 58.1, 58.9, 59.1, 59.2, 59.3, 59.4]

# The timestamp of the first sample. All other samples will be spaced at the rate
# of the channel.
start = datetime.utcnow()

my_precise_tc.write(start, temperatures)
```

If we had multiple channels, we would pass the same timestamp to each channel's `write`
method. This would ensure that the data is aligned across all channels.

```python
temperatures = [55, 55.1, 55.7, 57.2, 58.1, 58.9, 59.1, 59.2, 59.3, 59.4]
pressures = [100, 100.1, 100.7, 102.2, 103.1, 103.9, 104.1, 104.2, 104.3, 104.4]

start = datetime.utcnow()

my_precise_tc.write(start, temperatures)
my_precise_pt.write(start, pressures)
```

### Writing to a variable rate channel

Writing to a variable rate channel requires us to write to a channel's index before 
we write it's data. We'll create the following index-indexed pair as an example:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Create the index
timestamps = client.indexes.create(
    name="timestamps",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=True
)

# Create the temperature channel
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_tc",
    data_type=np.float32,
    index=timestamps
)
```

Then, we'll make sure to write timestamps to the index before we write the data to the
channel:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Our temperature data.
temperatures = [55, 55.1, 55.7, 57.2, 58.1]
first = sy.TimeStamp.now()
timestamps = [
    first,
    first + 1 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
    first + 2 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
    first + 3 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
    first + 4 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
]

# Write the timestamps to the index
timestamps.write(first, timestamps)

# Write the data to the channel
my_precise_tc.write(first, temperatures)
```

Notice how we align the two arrays using the common `first` timestamp. This tells Synnax
that the first sample in the `temperatures` array is associated with the first timestamp
in the `timestamps` array.

Synnax will raise a `ValidationError` if the index does not contain a corresponding 
timestamp for every sample in the data array. After all, it wouldn't make sense to have
a temperature reading without an associated timestamp.

## Writing to a Named Range

Writing to a named range takes away the burden of needing to correctly align the data
from different channels.

We'll create the following named range as an example:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Create the named range
burst_test = client.ranges.create(
    name="burst_test",
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(
        start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
        end=sy.TimeStamp.now() + 1 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR
    )
)
```

Then, we'll write to the named range using the `write` method:

```python
temperatures = [55, 55.1, 55.7, 57.2, 58.1, 58.9, 59.1, 59.2, 59.3, 59.4]
pressures = [100, 100.1, 100.7, 102.2, 103.1, 103.9, 104.1, 104.2, 104.3, 104.4]

# This call to write will assume that the timestamp of the first sample is the start
# of the range.
burst_test.write({
    "my_precise_tc": temperatures,
    "my_precise_pt": pressures,
})
```

## Using a Writer

While the above methods are great for writing static, existing data, it's common to want
to write data in a streaming fashion for use in control sequences and live dashboards.
The `Writer` class is designed to handle this use case (and is actually used under the
hood by the above methods).

Writers are a bit more complicated to operate, so we recommend reading the [concepts](/concepts/write-domains#transactions) page to learn more about
how they work.

### Opening a writer

We'll create the following index-indexed pair to use with our writer.

```python
import synnax as sy

# Create the index
timestamps = client.indexes.create(
    name="timestamps",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=True
)

# Create the temperature channel
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_tc",
    data_type=np.float32,
    index=timestamps
)
```

We recommend using writers within a context manager; this automatically closes it,
ensuring that resources have been freed and sockets are closed. To open the writer,
we use the `open_writer` method on the client and provide a starting timestamp for the 
first sample and a list of channels we'd like to write to.

```python
import time

with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
) as w:
    for i in range(100):
        w.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        })
        time.sleep(0.1)
    w.commit()
```

This example will write 100 samples to the `my_precise_tc` channel, each spaced
roughly 0.1 seconds apart, and will commit all writes when finished. 

It's typical to write and commit millions of samples over the course of hours or days,
intermittently calling commit to ensure that the data is persisted to the cluster.
