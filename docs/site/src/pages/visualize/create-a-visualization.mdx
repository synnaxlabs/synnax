This page walks you through creating a new visualization.

## Prerequisites

This page assumes you've already:

1. [Installed the Delta UI.](/visualize/get-started)
2. [Defined a Range.](/visualize/define-a-range)


## Create a Visualization

To create a new visualization, click the Add Tab button in the top right corner of the
central pane. Then, define the channels you want to plot along with the ranges you want to
query data for.

<Video client:only="react" id="/visualize/create-visualization" />

### Channel Parameters

<Table
    columns={[
        {
            key: "name",
            name: "Name",
        },
        {
            key: "description",
            name: "Description",
        },
    ]}
    data={[
        {
            name: "Y1",
            description: "The channels to plot on the left Y axis.",
        },
        {
            name: "Y2",
            description: "The channels to plot on the right Y axis.",
        },
        {
            name: "Ranges",
            description:
                "The ranges to query data for. All channels will be queried for data in each range.",
        },
        {
            name: "X",
            description: "The channel to plot on the X axis.",
        },
    ]}
/>

## Select a Range for Analysis

If you'd like to perform analysis on a specific section of data using a [client library](/analyze/get-started),
you can use the selector. To do so, hold the `Alt` key and click and drag
over the range you'd like to select. After lifting the mouse button, a menu will appear,
allowing you to copy the time range in the programming language of your choice.

<Video client:only="react" id="/visualize/select-range" />

Then, you can use the selected range in your client library. We've provided the following
example in Python:

```python
import synnax
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a client.
client = synnax.Synnax()

# PASTE THE SELECTED RANGE HERE.
tr = synnax.TimeRange(1676852636837258200, 1676853185745908500)

# Query data for the selected range.
pressures, _ = client.read(tr, "ec.pressure[12]")
times, _ = client.read(tr, "Time")

plt.plot(times, pressures)

plt.show()
```
