This page will show you how to connect to a Synnax cluster using Delta.

## Prerequisites

This page assumes you've already:

1. [Started a Synnax cluster.](/deploy/get-started)
2. [Installed the Delta UI.](/visualize/get-started)

## Adding a New Cluster

Adding a new cluster is as simple as clicking the **Add Cluster** button in the top
right corner of the cluster toolbar and entering your connection parameters, as shown
below.

<Video client:only="react" id="visualize/connect-a-cluster" />

This will add a new cluster to the list and set it as active. Delta continuously monitors
the connection to the cluster and displays it in the bottom right corner of the UI.

### Parameters

<Table
  columns={[
    {
      key: "name",
      name: "Name"
    },
    {
      key: "description",
      name: "Description"
    }
  ]}
  data={[
    {
      name: "Name",
      description: "A human-readable name for the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Host",

    },
    {

    },
    {
      name: "Username",
      description: "The username to use when connecting to the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Password",
      description: "The password to use when connecting to the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Secure",
      description:
        "A boolean value indicating whether to use TLS when connecting to the cluster. This parameter only works with secure clusters."
    }
  ]}
/>

## Switching Clusters

If you have multiple clusters, you can switch between them by double clicking on the
cluster you want to connect to in the cluster toolbar.
