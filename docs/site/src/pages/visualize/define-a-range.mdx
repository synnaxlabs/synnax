This page walks you through creating a new [range](/concepts/read-ranges) to visualize
an area of interest.

## Prerequisites

This page assumes you've already:

-   [Installed the Visualization UI.](/visualize/get-started)
-   [Connected to a Synnax cluster.](/visualize/connect-a-cluster)

## Create a New Range

Creating a new range is as easy as clicking the Add Range button in the workspace toolbar,
and entering the time range you're interested in querying.

### Parameters

<Table
    columns={[
        {
            key: "name",
            name: "Name",
            width: 125,
        },
        {
            key: "description",
            name: "Description",
        },
    ]}
    data={[
        {
            name: "Name",
            description: "A human-readable name for identifying the range",
        },
        {
            name: "Start Date",
            description: "The start date of the range.",
        },
        {
            name: "Start Time",
            description:
                "The start time of the range. This value is inclusive, meaning any samples with a timestamp equal to the start time will be included in the range.",
        },
        {
            name: "End Date",
            description: "The end date of the range.",
        },
        {
            name: "End Time",
            description:
                "The end time of the range. This value is exclusive, meaning any samples with a timestamp equal to the end time will not be included in the range.",
        },
    ]}
/>
