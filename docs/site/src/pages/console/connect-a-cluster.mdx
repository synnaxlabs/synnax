## Prerequisites

This page assumes you've already:

- [Started a cluster](/deploy/get-started)
- [Installed the Synnax console](/console/get-started)

## Adding a New Cluster

Adding a new cluster is as simple as clicking the **Add Cluster** button in the top
right corner of the cluster toolbar and entering your connection parameters, as shown
below.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/connect-a-cluster" />

This will add a new cluster to the list and set it as active. The console continuously 
monitors the connection to the cluster and displays it in the bottom right corner of the UI.

### Parameters

<Table
  columns={[
    {
      key: "name",
      name: "Name"
    },
    {
      key: "description",
      name: "Description"
    }
  ]}
  data={[
    {
      name: "Name",
      description: "A human-readable name for the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Host",
      description: "The hostname or IP address of the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Port",
      description: "The port number of the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Username",
      description: "The username to use when connecting to the cluster. If you didn't set a username when starting the cluster, this defaults to 'synnax'."
    },
    {
      name: "Password",
      description: "The password to use when connecting to the cluster. If you didn't set a password when starting the cluster, this defaults to 'seldon'."
    },
    {
      name: "Secure",
      description:
        "A boolean value indicating whether to use TLS when connecting to the cluster. This parameter only works with secure clusters."
    }
  ]}
/>

<div class="info warning">
<b>Note - </b> The console will not connect to remote clusters (i.e. host is not 'localhost')
started with the `--insecure` flag.
</div>

## Switching Clusters

If you have multiple clusters, you can switch between them by double clicking on the
cluster you'd like to to connect in the toolbar.
