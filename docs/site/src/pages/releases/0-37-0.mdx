Synnax v0.37.0 is our final release for 2024, and is focused on touching up many of the
features our team has built over the past year.

### More Schematic Symbols

We've added a number of new schematic symbols to the Synnax Console. These include flow
meters, flame arresters, new valves, pumps, heat exchangers, strainers, and a thruster.

### Minor Improvements

- Cleaned up the look of the schematic set point component, and prevented `NaN` from
  being considered a valid input value.
- Groups are now positioned above all other items within the resources toolbar, making
  it easier to navigate the tree.
- Upgraded a number of dependencies to make the Synnax Python client compatible with
  Python 3.13.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed line plot annotations not displaying correctly when a title is also visible on a
  plot.
- Made it impossible to configure an OPC UA read task when the sample rate is less than
  than the array size.
- Fixed an issue where importing a schematic would mistakenly create a new window.
- Removed needless orientation selectors from the schematic switch and button
  components.
- Fixed an issue where modals would not clear correctly when switching between
  workspaces.
- Blocked the user from selecting variable length data types when creating a non-virtual
  channel from within the Synnax Console.
- Fixed issue where schematic snapshots could not be renamed from their tab name.
- Fixed an issue where a deleted table would continue to render its values over an
  existing visualization.
