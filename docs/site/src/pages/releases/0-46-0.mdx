Synnax v0.46 introduces the first release of our new automation language, Arc. We've
also redesigned the browsing experience for ranges in the Console, added a new gauge
component, and, as always, introduced a number of bug fixes and performance
improvements.

### Arc

Arc is the first iteration of our long term plan to build a unified automation language
for Synnax. Arc is a hybrid language that allows for building programs using both a
visual and a text-based representation. Today, we're releasing the first version of the
visual language for implementing alarms within Synnax.

### Range Explorer

<Image client:only="react" id="releases/0-46-0/range-explorer" themed={false} />

We've redesigned the way you browse ranges in the Console. We've removed the unwieldy
Resources Toolbar and replaced it with an intuitive range explorer. The explorer let's
you search for ranges, filter by their labels, and favorite ranges for easy access and
visualization.

We've also added a new status indicator that shows the progress state of a range: to-do,
in-progress, and complete. These indicators make it easy to see which operations are
active and which have been completed.

### Gauge Symbol

<Flex.Box x justify="center">
  <Image
    client:only="react"
    id="releases/0-46-0/gauge"
    themed={false}
    style={{ width: 350 }}
  />
</Flex.Box>

Our new Schematic gauge symbol is a great way to display a bar-indicator representing
the value of a gauge. To use it, simply drag and drop it into a schematic.

### Bug Fixes and Other Improvements

- Fixed an issue where OPC UA nodes with periods in their names were not displayed
  correctly inside of the Read Task configuration dialog.
- Improved the performance of the Console telemetry streaming infrastructure by using a
  new and improved telemetry frame encoding mechanism.
- Improved the smoothness of toolbar actions (opening, renaming, deleting, etc.) by
  implementing more efficient caching mechanisms.
- Reduced the number of logs produced by the Core that were not useful for debugging
  purposes.
- Significantly improved Core storage engine performance by increasing meta-data cache
  sizes.
