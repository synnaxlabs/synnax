<LabJack />

Synnax version 0.34 introduces a built-in
[LabJack driver](/reference/device-drivers/labjack) supporting all T-Series devices.

You can use a [write task](/reference/device-drivers/labjack/write-task) to control
digital and analog outputs on the device, and a
[read task](/reference/device-drivers/labjack/read-task) to acquire data from inputs.

Synnax currently only supports LabJack devices on Windows, although we plan to add
support for other operating systems soon.

### Taring Functionality

Both [National Instruments](/reference/device-drivers/ni) and
[LabJack](/reference/device-drivers/labjack) read tasks now support taring
functionality. This feature allows you to zero out the current value of a read task.

### Other Minor Improvements and Bug Fixes

- Improved schematic connection line pathing.
- Implemented [Python client](/reference/python-client) support for configuring and
  running [OPC UA read tasks](/reference/device-drivers/opc-ua/read-task).
- Font sizes on a [schematic](/reference/console/schematics) value are now configurable.
- [Schematic](/reference/console/schematics) values can now be displayed in scientific
  notation.

### Breaking Changes

This release does **not** introduce any breaking changes.
