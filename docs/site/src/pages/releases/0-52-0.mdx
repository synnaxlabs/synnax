<Release
    version="0.52.0"
    date="Feb 22, 2026"
    title="HTTP Device Support"
>

Synnax v0.52 introduces our new HTTP device driver for integrating with REST APIs and
web services. We've also added support for extended analog input channels on the LabJack
T7.

### HTTP Device Driver

Our new HTTP device driver allows you to connect Synnax to any REST API or web service
directly from the Console. A deployed Synnax Driver will now discover and communicate
with HTTP endpoints for both data acquisition and control.

Read tasks poll one or more endpoints at a configurable rate and write response data into
Synnax channels. You can extract specific fields from nested JSON response bodies, and
timestamps can be sourced from the API response or generated automatically.

Write tasks send HTTP requests when Synnax channel values change. Request bodies can
combine live channel values with static fields and auto-generated values like timestamps.

The driver also includes built-in health monitoring that periodically checks endpoint
availability, with results displayed in the Console's device status indicators.
Authentication is supported out of the box, including token, API key, and basic
username/password methods.

### LabJack T7 Extended Analog Inputs

The Console and Driver now support extended analog input channels (AIN 48–127) on the
LabJack T7 when used with the MUX80 analog multiplexer. Previously, only channels
AIN 0–13 were available.

### Removal of Lua Sequences

Lua-based embedded sequences have been fully removed from Synnax. This includes the
language server, the sequence driver, and all related Console UI. Users who have not yet
migrated their Lua sequences to [Arc](/reference/control/arc/get-started) should do so
before upgrading.

  versions.
