<EtherCAT />

Synnax v0.51 introduces support for reading from and writing to
[EtherCAT](/reference/driver/ethercat) devices.

We've also made a number of improvements to the Arc programming language. Most notably,
Arc is now completely compatible with the Synnax control authority system.

As always, this release comes with a number of performance, stability, and user
experience improvements to Synnax.

### EtherCAT Driver

Our new driver supports reading from and writing to slaves on an EtherCAT network. A
deployed Synnax driver will now automatically discover EtherCAT devices on a network,
and acts as a master for both real-time data acquisition and control.

The [read task](/reference/driver/ethercat/read-task) can be used to acquire data from
output, while the [write task](/reference/driver/ethercat/write-task) can be used to
send commands to outputs.

#### Real-Time Support

When deployed on Linux-based operating systems with the real-time kernel enabled (such
as [Ubuntu 24.04 Pro](https://ubuntu.com/pro)), the Synnax Driver will automatically
leverage the real-time capabilities of the operating system to achieve deterministic
cycle times.

This is our recommended deployment configuration when using Synnax for real-time control
of EtherCAT devices.

#### Non-Real-Time Support

The Synnax Driver also supports EtherCAT on non real-time operating systems, such as
macOS and Windows. In these environments, Synnax will leverage the tools available on
the host to achieve maximum performance, but deterministic cycle times are not
guaranteed.

### Arc Control Authority

Arc is now fully compatible with Synnax's
[control authority](/reference/control/arc/concepts/control-authority) system. When
multiple writers target the same channel, authority determines whose values take effect.
This applies across all writer types, including Arc programs, Python scripts, and
schematic controls.

The `authority` keyword sets a program's priority level from 0 to 255, where higher
values take precedence. You can set a uniform level, assign different levels per
channel, or change authority at runtime with `set_authority`:

```arc
// default 200, with per-channel overrides for press_vlv_cmd and vent_vlv_cmd
authority (
    200
    press_vlv_cmd 100
    vent_vlv_cmd 150
)

sequence main {
    stage monitor {
        sensor -> filter{} -> output,
        sensor > THRESHOLD => abort
    }
    stage abort {
        // escalate at runtime to override all other writers
        set_authority{value=255},
        0 -> press_vlv_cmd,
        1 -> vent_vlv_cmd
    }
}

start_cmd => main
```

This makes it possible to start at a moderate level, assign fine-grained priorities per
channel, and escalate when conditions require it. For example, an abort stage can jump
to 255 to take precedence over all other writers.

For the full details on declaring authority, runtime changes, and multi-writer
coordination, see the
[control authority documentation](/reference/control/arc/concepts/control-authority).

### Other Minor Improvements and Bug Fixes

#### Console

- Fixed importing and exporting of Arc sequences.
- Fixed an issue where Cores could not be removed from the login page.
- Improved the display of task statuses, allowing for more detailed information to be
  displayed.
- Added new context menu items on the Core list in the login page, allowing for editing
  and refreshing connections.

#### Core

- Improved search indexing performance and reduced memory usage. Synnax Cores now
  consume less memory while idle.
- Fixed an issue where Arc programs would take progressively longer to compile as more
  channels were created in the Core.

#### TypeScript Client

- Fixed an issue where the TypeScript client would incorrectly block the creation of
  channels with invalid names even when the Core was started with
  `--disable-channel-name-validation`.
