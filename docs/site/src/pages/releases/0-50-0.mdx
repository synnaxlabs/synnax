<Release

    title="Arc Automations"
>

Synnax v0.50 is the first release of the text-based version of our new programming
language, Arc.

### Arc Sequences

With the new release of Arc, you can now create sequences using a text-based editor in
the Synnax Console, and deploy them directly onto a Synnax Core or Synnax Driver. The
Synnax Console provides built-in documentation, syntax highlighting, and error checking,
and Arc sequences will be deployed and run directly from hardware using the Core or
Driver.

### Views

{/* TODO: add image */}

Views are a new feature that allows you to save frequently used searches of ranges and
statuses. You can create views by opening the Status Explorer or Range Explorer, editing
the filters for given labels or other criteria, and then creating a new view. This view
can then be saved and loaded later for quick access.

### Documentation Refactor

The Synnax documentation site has been refactored by consolidating the Python and
TypeScript client documentations into a single section, with code snippets for each
language. This should make it easier to find information by reducing the number of pages
on the site, and leaving a single place where information is found about ranges, writing
data, and more.

### Windows Service

The Synnax Core can now be installed and run as a Windows service. This allows the Core
to boot up automatically when the PC boots, be run as a background process, and to be
managed by the Windows Service Manager.
