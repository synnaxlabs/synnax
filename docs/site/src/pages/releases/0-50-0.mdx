<Release
    version="0.50.0"

    title="Arc Automations"
>

Synnax v0.50 is the first release of the text-based version of our new programming
language, Arc.

### Arc Sequences

Arc lets you create sequences using a text-based editor in the Synnax Console and deploy
them directly onto a Synnax Core or Driver. The Console provides built-in documentation,
syntax highlighting, and error checking to help you write automations quickly and
correctly.

Arc's sequence system lets you define complex multi-stage automation workflows,
including pressurization sequences, test procedures, and safety interlocks, that
automatically transition between stages based on real-time sensor conditions. The
reactive execution model means your control logic responds to sensor changes without
writing polling loops; values flow through your automation, and downstream calculations
update instantly when inputs change.

Arc also handles the complexity of stateful automations for you. Hold timers, counters,
integrators, and PID controllers all maintain their state across execution cycles
without manual bookkeeping.

Arc automations run in real-time on supported operating systems such as Ubuntu 24.04 Pro
and NI Linux RT, enabling precise, accurately timed control algorithms for the most
demanding tasks.

### Views

</Diagram>

Views allow you to save frequently used searches of ranges and statuses. You can create
views by opening the Status Explorer or Range Explorer, editing the filters for given
labels or other criteria, and then creating a new view. This view can then be saved and
loaded later for quick access.

### Documentation Refactor

The Synnax documentation site has been refactored by consolidating the Python and
TypeScript client documentations into a single section, with code snippets for each
language. This should make it easier to find information by reducing the number of pages
on the site, and leaving a single place where information is found about ranges, writing
data, and more.

### Windows Service

The Synnax Core can now be installed and run as a Windows service. This allows the Core
to start automatically when the PC boots, run as a background process, and be managed by
the Windows Service Manager.

To see how to deploy Synnax as a Windows service, see the
[Core CLI Reference](/reference/core/cli-reference#service-windows-only).
