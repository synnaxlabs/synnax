### Schematic Button Functionality

The schematic button functionality has been extended to allow for three different modes:

- **Fire**: A value of true is written to the channel when the button is pressed. This
  was the default behavior of a button before.
- **Momentary**: A value of true is written to the channel when the button is pressed,
  and a value of false is written to the channel when the button is released.
- **Pulse**: A value of true, immediately followed by a value of false, is written to
  the channel when the button is pressed.

Console.
