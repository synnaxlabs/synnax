### Schematic Button Modes

Buttons on a schematic now have a new _mode_ property that can be set to one of the
following values:

- **Fire** -> A value of true is written to the channel when the button is pressed. This
  is the default behavior, and behaves the same as previous releases.
- **Momentary** -> A value of true is written to the channel when the button is pressed,
  and a value of false is written to the channel when the button is released.
- **Pulse** -> A value of true is written to the channel and immediately followed by a
  value of false.
