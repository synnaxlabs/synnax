### Role-Based Access Control

Instead of setting individual permissions for each user, you can now assign users to one
of four built-in roles: Owner, Engineer, Operator, and Viewer. Each role has a set of
permissions that determine what actions the user can perform. For more information, see
the [Users](/reference/console/users) page.

### Improved Status Handling for Drivers, Devices, and Tasks

Statuses for all Drivers, devices, and tasks are now displayed in the Status Explorer,
providing a unified view of your entire system's health.

      bottom: "-35rem",
      right: "-10rem",
      border: "0.5px solid var(--pluto-gray-l5)",
    }}

  />

#### OPC UA and Modbus Status Checking

Our OPC UA and Modbus integrations now periodically check the connection status of every
configured server, displaying results in the Status Explorer and Devices Toolbar.

### Channel Naming Conventions and Uniqueness

Channel names are now validated to ensure they only contain letters, digits, and
underscores, and cannot start with a digit. This ensures channels can be used as
variables in Arc programs without errors.

Channel names must also be unique, preventing potential mistakes when writing
automations or analyzing data.

Existing channels that do not conform to the new naming conventions will not be changed
automatically, so we recommend updating your channels to the new conventions to avoid
potential issues in the future.

The schematic editor toolbar now includes buttons for aligning, distributing, and
rotating selected elements.

### Minor Improvements and Bug Fixes

#### Console

- Added the ability to hide the schematic legend.
- Long notifications are now truncated to prevent overflow.
- Console updates can now be checked without being connected to a cluster.
- Fixed the "Add to new plot" button not working for ranges.
- Fixed the CSV data exporting not working for long time ranges.
- Fixed links on range metadata not opening correctly.
- Fixed tags with long text overflowing their containers.
- Fixed lists not paginating correctly.

#### Streaming

- Added a throttle rate parameter to streamers for limiting the rate at which telemetry
  is received. This reduces network traffic when streaming high-frequency data.

#### Core

- Fixed deeply nested calculated channels not retrieving historical data correctly.
- Fixed Arc automation statuses not being deleted when automations were removed.

#### Driver

- Fixed LabJack device scanning failing to detect connected devices.

#### Documentation

- Fixed inconsistencies in the Python client writer documentation.
