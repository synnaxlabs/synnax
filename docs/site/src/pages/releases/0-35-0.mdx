Synnax version 0.35.0 introduces a new table component, fixes a few issues with the
recently released LabJack driver, makes several improvements to schematic editing, and
fixes a number of performance related bugs.

### Table Component

The new console table component is a powerful tool for displaying and interacting with
tabular data. Tables are particularly useful for displaying data from many different
channels, and for displaying data that should be flagged for exceeding certain
thresholds.

### Schematic Improvements

#### New Symbols

10 new ISO compliant schematic symbols have been added to the symbol library: an ISO
Check Valve, Cylinder, ISO Relief Valve, Angled ISO Relief Valve, ISO Burst Disk, ISO
Cap, Vent, ISO Filter, Orifice Plate, and a T-Junction.

  themed={false}
  style={{ padding: "5rem", backgroundColor: "var(--pluto-dark-gray-l0)" }}
/>

#### New Edge Types

To allow for greater clarity on complex schematics, edges can now have specific styles
associated with their corresponding type. The currently available options are: Pipe
(default), Electric Signal, Secondary, Jacketed, Hydraulic, Pneumatic, and Data Signal.

#### Label Improvements

Labels no longer cause elements to shift when their text is edited, and label alignment
has been fixed to correctly justify the _text_ of the label instead of the label itself
around it's symbol.

You can also now **double click** on a label to edit it's text. Hit `esc` to cancel
label editing.

#### The `Q` Command

When a symbol is selected, hitting the `Q` key will open a quick layout menu for the
symbol. The rotation controls let you rotate the symbol, and the gray boxes allow you to
drag the label or control chip of a symbol to a new location.

    position: "relative",
    left: "50%",
    transform: "translateX(-50%)",
  }}
/>

#### Color Picker now has Recent Colors

The console color picker now has a section that displays a hybrid of the ten most
recently/frequently used colors. This makes it easier to pick consistent colors across
your schematic.

    maxWidth: 200,
    position: "relative",
    left: "50%",
    transform: "translateX(-50%)",
  }}
/>

### Other Minor Improvements and Bug Fixes

- Reduced response times for configuring [LabJack](/reference/device-drivers/labjack)
  tasks.
- Enable support for multiple
  [OPC UA read tasks](/reference/device-drivers/opc-ua/read-task) on a single OPC UA
  Server
- Improved shutdown procedure for the Synnax server and embedded driver.
- The light schematic symbol can now accept telemetry types beyond just boolean sources,
  and includes a threshold setting to trigger state changes

### Breaking Changes

While this release does **not** introduce any backwards incompatible changes, the
updated label alignment system may cause the edges of existing schematics to shift.
