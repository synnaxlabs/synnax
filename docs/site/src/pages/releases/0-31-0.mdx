### Summary

#### User Registration & Access Control

Synnax version 0.31 introduces long awaited user registration and access control
features. You can now register users via the
[command palette](/reference/console/ui-overview#search-and-command-palette). Once
registered, one of two permissions can be granted to a user: admin and schematic edit.

- **Admin** users have the permission to perform any task, including registering,
  removing, and changing the permissions of other users.
- **Schematic edit** defines whether a user is allowed to create and edit schematics.

These two permission sets are the first of many to come.

#### New Schematic Symbols

This release also introduces six new schematic symbols.
