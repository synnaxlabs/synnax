### Summary

Synnax version 0.32 makes an improvement to
[NI Analog Read Tasks](/reference/driver/ni/analog-read-task). The new version allows
you to acquire data from multiple devices in a single task. This is useful in one of two
scenarios:

1. You have multiple devices and you want to acquire data from all of them
   synchronously.
2. You have many different cards on a single chassis (e.g. cDAQ-9174) and you need to
   avoid hitting the maximum number of allowed tasks.

Instead of choosing the device at the top level of the task, you can now specify the
device for each channel.

### Breaking Changes

This release does **not** introduce any breaking changes. Previous NI analog read tasks
will be migrated to the new format automatically.
