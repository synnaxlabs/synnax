Synnax v0.41.0 introduces the first major overhaul fo the Console UI since it's initial
release. In the new device toolbar, we've added real-time information on device health.
It also includes a number of minor improvements to the Synnax Driver, and various bug
fixes.

### Console UI

Based on over a year of feedback and suggestions, we've redesigned the Console to
simplify navigation and improve workflows.

#### Deprecation and Eventual Removal of the Resources Toolbar

The resources toolbar was the single stop for accessing all of Synnax's main data
structures. Channels, ranges, workspaces, users, and more are all available from this
location. While this has advantages for flexibility, it has been a common source of
confusion for understanding how Synnax's data model is organized. Displaying all
resources in one place also posed a challenge for various resource-specific layout
customizations we wanted to make.

To address these issues, we've decided to split the resources pane into a series of
independent, category specific toolbars. There are new devices, users, channels, and
workspace toolbars. The range and task toolbars have also been moved to the left-hand
side of the Console.

We're leaving the original resources toolbar in the Console for now, but we'll be
removing it in a future release once the new toolbars can meet all necessary
functionality.

#### Removal of Bottom and Right Toolbars

Running complex operations involves building workspaces with large numbers of
visualizations, tasks, and other dialogs. This means that real-estate within the Console
is at a premium, and the bottom and right toolbars were occupying too much space for the
value they delivered.

We've now moved all status indicators and buttons to the top and left toolbars, and
allocated the freed space to the central mosaic.

#### Toolbar Hovering & Hotkeys

Opening a toolbar on the current Console causes the entire central layout mosaic to
shift, this can cause issues with visualizations such as schematics that are precisely
sized to fit within a particular view.

Often times, it's necessary to perform a quick task on a toolbar, such as starting or
stopping a task. In order to prevent layout shift, we've made it possible to hover and
overlay the toolbar without causing a layout shift in the mosaic.

We've also added a series of hotkeys to make interacting with the toolbars even more
efficient. For example, typing `C` will trigger the hover mode for the channels toolbar,
and double pressing `C` will open toolbar permanently.

### Device Toolbar

The new device toolbar provides real-time information on the status of Synnax Drivers
and the devices connected to them. Synnax Drivers that are actively running will now
show a blue heartbeat, and devices have a status indicators that shows the health of
their connection.

### Driver Task Auto-Start

We've implemented a new auto start mechanism for all Synnax Driver tasks. This is a
toggle that can be turned on and off within the task configuration dialog. When enabled,
the task will **automatically start** on configuration and **Driver startup**.

### Renaming Channels within Tasks

Previously, the only way to rename a channel bound to a task was within the resources
toolbar. We've added a new context menu item within all task configuration dialogs that
allows you to rename a particular channel from within the dialog itself.

### Schematic Symbols

An additional set of schematic symbols were added, including general polygon shapes, a
flow straightener, a heater, and more regulator shapes.
