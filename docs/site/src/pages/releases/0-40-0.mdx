Synnax v0.40.0 is a maintenance release that introduces no breaking changes, improves 
performance, and fixes a number of bugs.

### Driver Clock Skew Improvements

Our refactor of the driver in Synnax 0.39.0 made several major improvements, and,
unfortunately, introduced a few performance issues related to task timing.

In this release, we've introduced a new clock skew detection algorithm that
automatically corrects for timing offsets in hardware timed tasks. For more information,
see our new [timing](/reference/device-drivers/timing) documentation.

### Warnings on Slow Data Acquisition Tasks

In previous versions of Synnax, tasks that were set at too high of a stream rate would
silently fall behind, and, samples would eventually be dropped. This release introduces
a new warning mechanisms that updates the Console task configuration dialog when Synnax
cannot keep up with the requested stream rate.

### Improved Device Disconnection Retry

We've improved the device disconnection retry mechanisms for NI, LabJack, and OPC UA to
better handle unexpected cable disconnections and loss of power.

### Cleaner Transfer of Devices Across Drivers

We've implemented a smoother mechanisms for moving data acquisition modules across
drivers, ensuring that existing tasks on a device are correctly transferred and started
on new drivers.

### Other Improvements

- It's now possible to change the identifier of a device after configuring it.
- Added the location of a device to it's drop down selector, making it easier to
  differentiate devices of the same name running on separate drivers.

### Bug Fixes

- On Windows, the cursor in the embedded control sequence editor would be slightly
  offset, landing in the middle of the character on long lines. This has been fixed.
- Fixed an issue where dragging and dropping windows outside of the Console would be
  slow to open.
- The `set_authority` method in the embedded control sequence editor was not correctly
  detected by intellisense as an available function. It should now correctly appear
  as a built-in function.
