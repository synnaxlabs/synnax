    title="Driver and Embedded Control Sequence Improvements"

Synnax v0.40.0 is a maintenance release that introduces no breaking changes, improves
performance of the Synnax Driver, and fixes a few bugs related to the embedded control
sequences.

### Driver Clock Skew Improvements

Our refactor of the Driver in Synnax v0.39 made several major improvements, and,
unfortunately, introduced a few performance issues related to task timing. In this
release, we've introduced a new
[clock skew detection algorithm](/reference/driver/timing) that automatically corrects
for timing offsets in hardware timed tasks.

### Warnings on Slow Data Acquisition Tasks

In previous versions of Synnax, tasks that were set at too high of a stream rate would
silently fall behind drop data samples. This release introduces a new warning mechanisms
that updates the Console task configuration dialog and logs a warning to the Driver logs
when Synnax cannot keep up with the requested stream rate.

### Improved Device Disconnection Retry

We've improved the device disconnection retry mechanisms for NI, LabJack, and OPC UA to
better handle unexpected cable disconnections and loss of power.

### Cleaner Transfer of Devices Across Drivers

We've implemented a smoother mechanisms for moving data acquisition modules across
Drivers, ensuring that existing tasks on a device are correctly transferred and started
on new Drivers.

### Other Improvements

- It's now possible to change the identifier of a device after configuring it.
- Added the location of a device to the device drop-down list selectors.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the location of the cursor in the embedded control sequence editor on Windows.
- Fixed an issue where dragging and dropping windows outside of the Console would be
  slow to open.
- Added the [`set_authority`](/reference/control/embedded/reference#control-authority)
  method to the embedded control sequence editor code completion.
