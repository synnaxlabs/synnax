Synnax v0.36.0 introduces several new quality of life improvements and bug fixes,
including a new line plot annotation tool, schematic undo / redo, a new way to select
the time of the range, and a refactored LabJack write task.

### Line Plot Annotation Tool

A new annotation tool has been added to the line plot. This tool allows you to add
horizontal lines to the plots to mark thresholds or other important values. This tool
can be accessed by clicking the 'Annotations' tab in the line plot toolbar.

### Schematic Undo / Redo

You can now undo and redo changes to a schematic. This feature is possible by using the
`Ctrl + Z` and `Ctrl + Shift + Z` keyboard shortcuts on a schematic that you are
editing.

### New Range DateTime Selector

Synnax has a refactored way to select dates and times of ranges. This can be opened by
selecting the calendar icon that appears to the right of the time on the create range
modal. You can now quickly type a short phrase and have an AI will automatically suggest
the appropriate date and time.

### Breaking Changes

This release introduces a breaking change in the communication protocol that the server
and console use to communicate. This change means that **console versions 0.36.0 and
newer** will not work with **server versions of 0.35.0 and older**. To avoid issues,
please ensure that your server and console are updated to the same version.
