**What Changed:**

Synnax v0.47 fixes a critical issue that caused schematics to become unresponsive when a
higher authority process acquired control of a channel on the schematic. Schematics now
handle partial authorization gracefully.

**Impact:**

- Schematics no longer freeze when control authority changes on a channel
- Commands succeed on authorized channels while unauthorized channels are automatically
  skipped
- More reliable operation in multi-user and multi-system environments

This fix significantly improves the reliability of schematics in complex control
scenarios where multiple systems or users may be managing different aspects of the
system simultaneously.
