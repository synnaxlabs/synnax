Our Lua-based calculated channels were a powerful first step towards deriving values in
real-time from a set of input channels. They also came with several limitations, notably
the inability to create calculations that relied on channels with different indexes, and
the lack of statistical functions such as averages, minimum, maximum, and standard
deviation.

Our new Arc language is becoming the bedrock for building automations in Synnax, and the
next step in its evolution is the introduction of Arc-based calculated channels. This
uses a new, text-based syntax. It allows for calculations using mixes of persisted
channels with different indexes, virtual channels, and even other calculated channels.

We've also added three statistical aggregation functions: `avg`, `min`, and `max`. These
functions can be used to calculate the average, minimum, and maximum values of a
calculation over a time- or trigger-based window.

### Deprecation of Lua-Based Calculations

With the introduction of Arc-based calculated channels, Lua-based calculations are
deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We'll automatically attempt to
migrate compatible Lua-based calculations to their Arc equivalent, and will provide
warnings for incompatible calculations that must be manually re-written.

In this release, Lua-based calculations will continue to function normally, but creating
new Lua-based calculations will not be allowed.

## Important Breaking Changes

### Auto-Commit is now Enabled by Default with All Writers

[Auto-Commit](/reference/concepts/writes#auto-commit) is used to immediately persist
written data to Synnax, as opposed to calling `commit` manually.

Over the course of several release, we've observed that it's far more common to write
data in scenarios where you'd want to have auto-commit enabled (telemetry streaming,
control) than in scenarios where you'd want to disable it.

As a result, we've made the decision to enable auto-commit by default with writers in
all of our client libraries. Any code that implicitly disables auto-commit will now need
to explicitly disable it.

### Changes to Writer Behavior Under Mixed Control Authority

Synnax v0.47 fixes a critical issue that caused schematics to become unresponsive across
all channels when a higher authority process acquired control of a channel on the
schematic.

In this scenario, a schematic will have mixed control over a set of actuators. For
example, a schematic is controlling `cmd_channel_1` and `cmd_channel_2`. Both of these
have independent, associated indexes (`cmd_channel_1_time` and `cmd_channel_2_time`). In
the scenario where the schematic operator has control over `cmd_channel_1` but not
`cmd_channel_2` and auto commit is enabled, any writes to `cmd_channel_1` would fail
regardless of the fact that the operator has control over it.

We've changed the behavior of writers to support partial writes, meaning that a caller
may have control over only a subset of channels in a particular write. When the user
writes to a mixture of the channels it has control over as well as those it does not,
all writes to a channel that it has control over will succeed.

This fix significantly improves the reliability of schematics in complex control
scenarios where multiple systems or users may be managing different aspects of the
system simultaneously.

### Bug Fixes and Other Improvements

#### Core

- Fixed an issue where devices would accidentally regroup on startup.
- Fixed channel renaming synchronization issues across Synnax.
- Fixed issues with opening streamers when the channel key is 0.

#### Console

- Added a new Arc toolbar with language server support for improved code editing and
  development experience.
- Fixed an issue where CSV exports failed for channels with different indexes, allowing
  proper data export from line plots.
- Improved workspace management with better synchronization and export functionality
  that now uses layout names for JSON files.
- Fixed schematic edge selection, node selectors, and symbol creation for more reliable
  schematic editing.
- Fixed styling issues for long channel names in task configuration dialogs.
- Fixed tooltip coloring to improve visual consistency.
- Added a copy properties context menu item to ontology toolbars for easier
  configuration management.

#### Driver

- Fixed OPC UA write task reliability, including proper handling of boolean writes.
- Fixed OPC UA browser status display to show accurate connection states.
- Added validation for NI Analog Read task minimum sample rate to prevent configuration
  errors.
- Fixed startup warnings in the embedded driver for cleaner initialization.
- Enabled auto-commit for Modbus driver to improve data persistence.
