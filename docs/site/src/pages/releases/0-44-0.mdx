Synnax v0.44 introduces an embedded Console into the Synnax Cluster, which can be used
in place of the desktop Console application.

We've also improved the data export process by adding dedicated CSV export buttons to
both ranges and line plots.

As always, this release comes with a number of additional performance, stability, and
user experience improvements to Synnax.

### Embedded Console

Every Synnax cluster now comes with an embedded, browser-based Console. After starting
the cluster using the default port of `9090`, you can access the Console at
`http://localhost:9090`.

All functionality of the desktop Console is available in the embedded Console, with the
notable exception of multi-window functionality.

The desktop Console will continue to be supported, and it's still our preferred way to
work with a Synnax deployment.

### Data Export

We've added dedicated CSV export buttons to both ranges and line plots, making it much
easier to export data from Synnax for analysis.

</Flex.Box>

### Legend Y-Axis Indicators

The line plot legend now separates lines into groups by their corresponding y-axis.

### Added Methods for Reading the Latest Values from a Channel

We've added new methods in the Python and TypeScript clients for reading the most recent
values written to one or more channels.

##### Python

In Python, simply call `read_latest` with the channels and the number of values you want
to read. Additional documentation can be found
[here](/reference/python-client/read-data).

```python
import synnax as sy

client = sy.Synnax()

print(client.read_latest(["daq_time", "ox_pt_1"], 1))
# {
#   "daq_time": [1723200000000000000],
#   "ox_pt_1": [100.0]
# }
```

##### TypeScript

The TypeScript client has a `readLatest` method that works in the same way. Additional
documentation can be found [here](/reference/typescript-client/read-data).

```typescript
import { Synnax } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const client = new Synnax();

console.log(await client.readLatest(["daq_time", "ox_pt_1"], 1));
// {
//   "daq_time": [1723200000000000000],
//   "ox_pt_1": [100.0]
// }
```

### Minor Improvements and Bug Fixes

- Added status indicators for devices and drivers to selection dialogs.
- Made a number of updates to real-time data fetching infrastructure, improving the
  reactivity and performance of the console.
- Added `Command + W` and `Control + W` keyboard shortcuts to close modals, and added a
  press and hold delay to close the application on MacOS.
- Fixed an issue where the Palette would not properly switch between command and search
  modes when closed and re-opened.
- Added drag and drop importing and exporting of tasks.
