Synnax v0.38.0 is our first release of 2025, and contains a large number of new features
including beta calculated channels, workspace importing, and more.

### Calculated Channels

[Calculated channels](/reference/console/calculated-channels) are a new feature that
allows for server-side calculations to be performed on channels in real-time. Calculated
channels work by taking a Lua script that describes the calculation to be performed on
the channel, including what channels the calculated channel takes data from.

Calculated channels are currently in beta, and you may run into stability issues and
unexpected behavior while using them. If you run into any issues, please report it to
the Synnax team.

### Workspace Importing and Exporting

The Synnax Console now supports sharing workspaces via a directory configuration.
Workspaces can be shared by
[importing and exporting](/reference/console/workspaces#sharing-via-file) workspaces
into directories to be stored on your desktop.

### Windows Core Installer

The Windows version of the Core can now be installed by an installer. This means you
only need to download a single installer file, and then run it to install the Core. More
information can be found on our [Core installation page](/reference/core/installation).

### Python CLI Command Deprecation

The previous `synnax` and `synnaxkit` CLI commands to access the Python client have been
deprecated to avoid a name collision with the `synnax` CLI command for the Core. To
access the Python client, you should now use the `sy` command:

```bash
sy login
```

### Improvements

- A refactored version of the NI Digital Write Task was made with a more intuitive UI.
- Schematic snapshots can now be renamed from their tab name.
- NI Analog Read Task table scaling now only allows CSV files to be passed in.
- The Synnax Demo Core is now automatically available on the Cores Dropdown selector
  when starting the Synnax Console.
- Modals and the version info window are now no longer saved in workspaces.
- Groups are now positioned above all other items within the Resources Toolbar.
- Line plots render `uint8` data faster.
- `Cmd + A` can now be used to group all schematic elements.

### Bug Fixes

- A needless orientation selector was removed from the schematic switch and button
  components.
- A bug where items in the Resources Toolbar would get duplicated is now fixed.
- Multi-Core clusters now support key-value state forwarding.
- Groups can now be grouped correctly within the Resources Toolbar.
- Fixed an issue where the delete column option on the table cell context menu did not
  work.
- Fixed an issue where the python client examples were not working.
- Fixed an issue where deep linking was not working on Windows.
