Synnax v0.45 adds the ability to create, edit, and import custom symbols for schematics.

We've also added metrics channels to the core node, which allow for monitoring the cpu
and memory usage of the node.

We've added staleness indicators to values in schematics. When a value has not been
updated for a certain amount of time (5s by default), the color of the value will change
to yellow.

Lastly, we've fixed minor issues with our frame encoding protocol, improved our Python
client documentation, and improved a number of other minor features.

### Custom Schematic Symbols

A long requested feature, you can now create, edit, and import custom symbols for
schematics. To do so, create a new symbol group in the schematic symbols browser, and
then create and edit symbols within that group.

Symbols and entire symbol groups can also easily be imported and exported for sharing
and/or version control.

### Metrics Channels

We've added metrics channels to the core node, which allow for monitoring the cpu and
memory usage of the node.

</Flex.Box>

These new channels are called `sy_node_x_cpu_percentage` and `sy_node_x_mem_percentage`,
where `x` is the host key of the node.

### Staleness Indicators

To better inform users about potentially misconfigured sensors and/or data acquisition
tasks, we've added staleness indicators to values in schematics. When a value has not
been updated for a certain amount of time (5s by default), the color of the value will
change to yellow. You can also configure the staleness timeout and color of a value in
the value form.

    themed={false}
    style={{ width: 350 }}
  />
</Flex.Box>

### Minor Improvements

- Fixed a minor issue where series in encoded frames would be sorted incorrectly,
  causing rare decoding issues in JSON series.
