Synnax v0.42.0 has been dedicated to improving the performance of the Synnax Core,
Driver, and Console UI, as well as refactoring the interfaces for writers in the Python,
C++, and TypeScript clients.

### Improved Client Library Writer API

We've received feedback that the current writer API in Python, C++, and TypeScript has
not been user friendly, especially when it comes to communicating errors. To address
this, we've redesigned the `Writer` class in all three languages to be more simple and
intuitive.

Instead of returning a boolean from calls to `write`, writers will now directly raise
any errors encountered during a write operation. This removes the need for calls to the
`error` method, so we've completely removed it.

#### Migration Guide

To migrate to the new writer API:

1. Remove any calls to `error`, and instead rely on the writer to raise an exception
   when an error occurs.
2. Remove any calls that check for the return value of `write`.

For example, Python code that was previously written as:

```python
with client.open_writer(
    channels=["pressure_0"],
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
) as w:
    for i in range(100)
        if not w.write(
            pressure_0=i,
            timestamp=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
        ):
            print(w.error())
```

is now simply:

```python
with client.open_writer(
    channels=["pressure_0"],
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
) as w:
    for i in range(100)
        w.write(pressure_0=i, timestamp=sy.TimeStamp.now())
```

And TypeScript code that was previously written as:

```typescript
with client.openWriter({
    channels: ["pressure_0"],
    start: sy.TimeStamp.now(),
}) as w:
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        if (!w.write({ pressure_0: i, timestamp: sy.TimeStamp.now() }))
            console.error(w.error());
    }
```

is now simply:

```typescript
with client.openWriter({
    channels: ["pressure_0"],
    start: sy.TimeStamp.now(),
}) as w:
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        w.write({ pressure_0: i, timestamp: sy.TimeStamp.now() });
```

### Performance Improvements

These changes have been focused on improving the throughput, reducing the latency, and
lowering the memory consumption of the Core, Driver, and Console UI. The following
details are somewhat technical, and are provided for those curious about the inner
workings of Synnax.

#### Network Communication

We've introduced a new telemetry encoding and decoding mechanism that reduces the amount
of data transferred over the network. For small messages, such as digital write commands
and their corresponding states, message sizes has been reduced by over 80% in most
cases.

#### Core

The read, write, and data streaming pipelines have been tuned for higher throughput and
lower memory consumption. Benchmarks have shown a 30% reduction in repeated memory
allocations a 20% reduction in CPU consumption.

#### Console

The core rendering mechanisms of the Console UI have been refactored to reduce both GPU
and CPU consumption. The most noticeable improvement is on devices that leverage GPUs
built-in to the CPU, where we're leveraging text-atlases to reduce the number of GPU
draw calls.

### Minor Improvements and Bug Fixes

- Added log persistence and rotation to the Synnax Core.
- Fixed an issue where copying time ranges from a selected region on a real-time plot
  would sometimes have incorrect values.
- Fixed auto-complete of `get` in calculated channels.
- Fixed Devices Toolbar statuses to still display when the toolbar is small.
- Fixed an issue where control status transfers would not display correctly on the
  Schematic.
