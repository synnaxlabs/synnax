### Login Page

As part of our ongoing effort to improve user access control, we're moving away from our
traditional core connection dropdown to a new login page. In the top right corner of the
screen, you'll no longer see the currently connected cluster, and instead see the
username of the currently logged in user.

On the login page, you'll be able to select a cluster to connect to, and then enter your
username and password to log in.

### Status Toolbar

<Diagram preview style="height: 425px; padding: 0rem 9rem">
  <Image
    client:only="react"
    id="releases/0-48-0/status-toolbar"
    style={{
      borderTopLeftRadius: "3rem",
      position: "absolute",
      width: 600,
      bottom: "-35rem",
      right: "-5rem",
      border: "1px solid var(--pluto-gray-l5)",
    }}
    themed={false}
  />
</Diagram>

We've added a new toolbar that allows you to favorite important statuses for quick
viewing. This also simplifies access to the status explorer and the status creation
modal.

### NI Counter Tasks

<Image client:only="react" id="releases/0-48-0/ni-counter-task" themed={false} />

We've added support for NI counter-based read tasks to Synnax. This allows you to read
data from frequency, period, pulse width, and a number of other channel types.

### Improved Measure Tool

<Image client:only="react" id="releases/0-48-0/measure-tool" themed={false} />

The previous measure tool was clunky and difficult to use. We've updated the point
selection mechanics to be more intuitive, added extra coloring and value displays to
simplify analysis, and fixed issues that caused the tool to misbehave when resizing the
line plot.

### Minor Improvements and Bug Fixes

#### Arc-Based Calculated Channels

We've continued to improve the stability and performance of our Arc-based calculated
channels. Nested calculations are now intelligently grouped and circular dependencies
are detected and reported.

#### Console

- Fixed an issue where the date and time inputs on range overviews would not correctly
  parse millisecond values.
- Fixed an issue where the `config.channels` field would not be properly initialized on
  certain tasks.

#### Core

- Fixed an issue where the docker image would not correctly grant permissions to the
  embedded driver.
