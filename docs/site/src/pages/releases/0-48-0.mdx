### Login Page

As part of our ongoing effort to improve user access control, we're moving away from the
Core Selector to a new login page. In the top right corner of the screen, you'll no
longer see the currently connected Core, and instead see the username of the currently
logged in user.

On the login page, you'll be able to select a Core to connect to, and then enter your
username and password to log in.

### Status Toolbar

<Diagram.Diagram preview style="height: 425px; padding: 0rem 9rem">
  <Image
    client:only="react"
    id="releases/0-48-0/status-toolbar"
    style={{
      borderTopLeftRadius: "3rem",
      position: "absolute",
      width: 600,
      bottom: "-35rem",
      right: "-5rem",
      border: "1px solid var(--pluto-gray-l5)",
    }}
    themed={false}
  />
</Diagram.Diagram>

We've added a new toolbar that allows you to favorite important statuses for quick
viewing. This toolbar also has buttons to create a status and open the Status Explorer.

### NI Counter Read Tasks

<Image client:only="react" id="releases/0-48-0/ni-counter-task" themed={false} />

We've added support for NI Counter Read Tasks to Synnax. This allows you to read data
from frequency, period, pulse width, and a number of other counter-based channel types.

### Improved Measure Tool

<Image client:only="react" id="releases/0-48-0/measure-tool" themed={false} />

The previous measure tool was clunky and difficult to use. We've updated the point
selection mechanics to be more intuitive, added extra coloring and value displays to
simplify analysis, and fixed issues that caused the tool to misbehave when resizing the
line plot.

### Minor Improvements and Bug Fixes

#### Console

- Fixed an issue where the date and time inputs on range overviews would not correctly
  parse millisecond values.
- Fixed an issue where the `config.channels` field would not be properly initialized on
  certain tasks.

#### Core

- Improved the stability and performance of Arc-based calculated channels by reporting
  circular dependencies and intelligently grouping nested calculations.
- Fixed an issue where the docker image would not correctly grant permissions to the
  embedded driver.
