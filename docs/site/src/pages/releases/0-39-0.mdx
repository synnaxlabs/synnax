Synnax v0.39.0 introduces embedded control sequences. Write and deploy tightly timed
control loops directly within the Synnax console. We've done major refactoring work on
our built-in device drivers to make them more reliable and user-friendly.

### Embedded Control Sequences

We've added a new [control sequencing system](/reference/control/embedded) that makes it
much easier to write, manage, and operate control sequences on devices. While this new
system does not replace the existing
[Python-based control sequences](/reference/control/python), it can serve as an
alternative in many situations.

### NI Linux RT Driver

We've released a [new, standalone version](/reference/device-drivers/standalone) of our
built-in device drivers for deployment on NI controllers running Linux RT. This allows
you to acquire data, control hardware, and even run embedded sequences directly on a
cRIO controller.

### NI Analog Write Task

We've added a new [NI Analog Write Task](/reference/device-drivers/ni/analog-write-task)
that allows you to write analog data to NI devices. This task is useful for a wide
variety of applications, such as generating test signals or controlling hardware.

### Driver Performance & Experience Improvements

We've rewritten a large portion of our device drivers to improve their performance and
stability. We've improved our device discovery mechanisms, made tasks more resilient to
device disconnects, and made a number of changes to the Console task configuration UI's
to make them easier to use.

### Removal of Deprecated `synnax` Python Client Command

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  The `synnax` command for the Python client was deprecated in v0.38.0 and is now
  removed. Please use `sy` instead.
</Note.Note>

### Other Improvements

- Improved and updated documentation for Writer error communication in the Python and
  TypeScript clients.
- Added support for changing the default console control authority.
- Implemented a clock skew detection algorithm that warns when Synnax clients
  communicating with a cluster have a significant time difference.
- Added warnings when you attempt to configure a task on a driver that is not alive.
- Improved error messages in the Python client when methods require named parameters.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a minor issue with releasing control authority from the Synnax Schematic.
- Fixed a race condition on server startup that would cause search indexing to fail.
- Fixed an issue where hitting `Ctrl + C` immediately after starting a cluster would not
  stop the cluster properly.
- Fixed an issue where the command & search palette would not properly switch between
  modes.
- Fixed an issue where the theme would not change automatically when the system theme
  changes.
