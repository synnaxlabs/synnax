Synnax v0.39.0 introduces embedded control sequences. Write and deploy tightly timed
control loops directly within the Synnax Console. We've done major refactoring work on
the Synnax Driver to make it more reliable and user-friendly.

### Embedded Control Sequences

We've added a new [control sequencing system](/reference/control/embedded) that makes it
much easier to write, manage, and operate control sequences on devices. While this new
system does not replace the existing
[Python-based control sequences](/reference/control/python), it can serve as an
alternative in many situations.

### NI Linux Real-Time Driver

We've released the [Synnax Driver](/reference/device-drivers/installation) as a separate
binary for deployment on NI controllers running NI Linux Real-Time. This allows you to
acquire data, control hardware, and even run embedded sequences directly on a cRIO
controller.

### NI Analog Write Task

We've added a new [NI Analog Write Task](/reference/device-drivers/ni/analog-write-task)
that allows you to write analog data to NI devices. This task is useful for a wide
variety of applications, such as generating test signals or controlling hardware.

### Driver Performance & Experience Improvements

We've rewritten a large portion of the Synnax Driver to improve its performance and
stability. We've improved our device discovery mechanisms, made tasks more resilient to
device disconnects, and made a number of changes to the Console task configuration UI's
to make them easier to use.

### Removal of Deprecated `synnax` Python Client Command

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  The `synnax` command for the Python client was deprecated in v0.38.0 and is now
  removed. Please use `sy` instead.
</Note.Note>

### Other Improvements

- Improved and updated documentation for Writer error communication in the Python and
  TypeScript clients.
- Added support for changing the default Console control authority.
- Implemented a clock skew detection algorithm that warns when Synnax clients
  communicating with a Core have a significant time difference.
- Added warnings when you attempt to configure a task on a Driver that is not alive.
- Improved error messages in the Python client when methods require named parameters.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a minor issue with releasing control authority from the Synnax Schematic.
- Fixed a race condition on Core startup that would cause search indexing to fail.
- Fixed an issue where hitting `Ctrl + C` immediately after starting a Core would not
  stop the Core properly.
- Fixed an issue where the Search and Command Palette would not properly switch between
  modes.
- Fixed an issue where the theme would not change automatically when the system theme
  changes.
