## What is Synnax?

Synnax is a platform for acquiring, controlling, and analyzing data from hardware 
systems. It delivers:

* High-performance, horizontally scalable storage for sensor & actuator data.
* Millisecond-latency data streaming.
* First-class exploratory and automated analysis using industry standard tools.
* User interfaces for visualization, instrumentation management, and manual control.
* An autosequence engine for automating complex control and analysis tasks.

Whether you're part of a large team with tens of thousands of sensors & actuators or an
individual working on a personal project, Synnax can help you develop and deploy your
hardware faster.

## How to Use These Docs

The Synnax documentation is divided into two categories. The [role](#role-guides) based documentation
contains workflow oriented guides for specific users, such as test engineers
or analysts, while the [component](#component-guides) based pages are oriented around the 
main components of the platform.

The navigation bar on the left contains a link to every page in the documentation. Use
the tabs at the top to switch between the role and component focused browsing. Feel
free to use the search bar at the top of the page to find specific topics.
