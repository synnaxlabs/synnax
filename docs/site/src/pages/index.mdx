## What is Synnax?

Synnax is a platform for acquiring, controlling, and analyzing data from
hardware systems. It delivers:

* High-performance, horizontally scalable storage for sensor & actuator data.
* Millisecond-latency data streaming.
* First-class exploratory and automated analysis using industry standard tools.
* User interfaces for visualization, instrumentation management, and manual
  control.
* A control sequence system for automating complex control and analysis tasks.

Whether you're part of a large team with tens of thousands of sensors &
actuators or an individual working on a personal project, Synnax can help you
develop and deploy your hardware faster.

## How to Use These Docs

The Synnax documentation is divided into two categories. The [guide](#guides)
based documentation contains workflow oriented guides for specific users, such
as test engineers or analysts, while the [reference](#references) based pages
are oriented around the main components of the platform.

The navigation bar on the left contains a link to every page in the
documentation. Use the tabs at the top to switch between the reference and guide
focused browsing. Feel free to use the search bar at the top of the page to find
specific topics.
