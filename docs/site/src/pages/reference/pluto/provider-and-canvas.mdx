Pluto requires a bit of scaffolding to get up and running. In this guide we'll walk you
through setting up a web worker to handle data fetching and rendering and wrapping your
application in the `Pluto.Provider` and `Pluto.Canvas` components.

<Divider.Divider x />

## The Web Worker Script

Pluto uses a Web Worker to handle data fetching and rendering. This keeps the rest of
the user interface smooth even under heavy load. To set up the Web Worker, you need to
configure a script and start the pluto worker process. Create a file called
`pluto-worker.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
import { pluto } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto/ether";

pluto.render();
```

<Divider.Divider x />

## The Provider

The `Pluto.Provider` component is necessary for the library to work, and should be used
at the root of your application. We also need to import the url of the worker script we
crated and provide it to the `Pluto.Provider` component. Here's a simple examples using
[vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for importing the worker script. We also need to import the
relevant css file for the components to render correctly.

```tsx
import { Pluto } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto";
import "@synnaxlabs/pluto/dist/style.css";
import WorkerUrl from "./pluto-worker?worker&url";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello Pluto!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

const Main = () => (
  <Pluto.Provider
    // Worker url so components can communicate with the worker thread.
    workerUrl={WorkerUrl}
    // Connection parameters to your Synnax cluster so that
    // components can fetch data when needed.
    connParams={{
      host: "demo.synnaxlabs.com",
      port: 9090,
      username: "synnax",
      password: "seldon",
      secure: true,
    }}
  >
    <App />
  </Pluto.Provider>
);
```

<Divider.Divider x />

## The Canvas

If you're using visualization components such as line plots, you'll need to set up a
rendering canvas for them to display on. This comes in the form of the `Pluto.Canvas`
component.

To increase performance, Pluto re-uses the canvas element across all visualizations. You
should only use one `Pluto.Canvas` component in your application, and we recommend
placing it as a fixed element that stretches across the display. Here's our previous
example edited to include the rendering canvas:

```tsx
import { Pluto, Canvas } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello Pluto!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

const Main = () => {
  return (
    <Pluto.Provider
      workerUrl={WorkerUrl}
      connParams={{
        host: "demo.synnaxlabs.com",
        port: 9090,
        username: "synnax",
        password: "seldon",
        secure: true,
      }}
    >
      <Canvas.Canvas
        style={{
          position: "fixed",
          top: 0,
          left: 0,
          width: "100%",
          height: "100%",
        }}
      >
        <App />
      </Canvas.Canvas>
    </Pluto.Provider>
  );
};
```

Now that you have Pluto set up, you can start using the components in your application.
