Powering the inner workings of the [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started),
Pluto is a [React](https://react.dev/) component library designed to build
high-performance, real-time user interfaces on top of Synnax. It provides a number of
components from simple buttons to complex data visualizations.

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  Pluto is currently in beta and it's API is subject to changes before reaching V1.

## Installation

Pluto is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@synnaxlabs/pluto), and can be
installed with your package manager of choice. We'll be using `npm` in our
documentation, but feel free to use `yarn`, `pnpm`, or any other package manager you
prefer.

```bash
npm install @synnaxlabs/pluto
```

<Divider.Divider x />

## Prerequisites and Important Notes

Pluto is designed for high performance and flexibility, which comes at the cost of ease
of use. We're working hard to improve user friendliness!

### Browser Compatibility

Pluto leverages **Web Workers** and the `OffscreenCanvas` API. These features are
generally available on the latest versions of all major browsers, but may not be
compatible with older versions.

See
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas#browser_compatibility)
for the `OffscreenCanvas` compatibility table.

### Bundle Size and Import Structure

Pluto is relatively large at around ~500kb minified and gzipped. We don't recommend
deploying applications that use Pluto in serverless environments or when building
interfaces designed to serve users with a slow network.

The component library is designed to be tree-shakeable, so you can import only the
components you need. For example, when importing a `Button` component, you can do:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto/button";
```

instead of importing the entire library:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto";
```

### Strict Mode Incompatibility

Pluto uses several mechanisms to manage communication between the main thread and the
Web Worker. These mechanisms are not yet compatible with React's Strict Mode. If you do
use Strict Mode, you may encounter errors or unexpected behavior.

### Components as Modules

When you import the `Button` above, you're not actually importing the `Button` component
itself. Instead, you're importing a module that exports the `Button`, along with other
useful utilities. You'll see this syntax with almost every component in Pluto:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto/button";

const regularButton = <Button.Button>Click me!</Button.Button>;
const onlyIconButton = <Button.Icon>ðŸš€</Button.Icon>;
```

We're accessing the `Button` or the `Icon` component from the `Button` module. We like
this syntax as it adds clarity to the codebase. Some of our users don't like it. If you
prefer to access the components directly, we recommend destructuring the module:

```typescript
import { Button as PButton } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto/button";
const { Button, Icon: IconButton } = PButton;

const regularButton = <Button>Click me!</Button>;
const onlyIconButton = <IconButton>ðŸš€</IconButton>;
```

<Divider.Divider x />

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed Pluto, it's time to set up the
[provider and canvas](/reference/pluto/provider-and-canvas) in your application.
