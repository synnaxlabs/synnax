When operating multi-device hardware systems that also require manual control through
operators, understanding which entities have control over actuators in a system is
essential. Synnax's control authority and handoff mechanisms allows for smooth
multi-operator and multi-automation interaction.

## Control Authority

Every entity that writes data to Synnax has an assigned control authority for every
channel that it is writing to. The control authority is an 8-bit unsigned integer, which
means minimum authority is 0 and maximum authority is 255.

When a control sequence is started, it assigns a control authority to each channel that
it is writing to. Suppose an existing control sequence is writing to a channel. If the
new sequence has a higher authority than the existing sequence, the new sequence will
take control of the channel. Otherwise, the new sequence will not be able to write to
the channel until the existing sequence releases control.

In the case of equal authority, the first sequence to take control will maintain control
of the channel.

## Mixed Authorities

A sequence may have different control authorities for different channels. For example,
an emergency stage in Arc can escalate authority on critical channels while leaving
others at normal priority:

```arc
stage emergency {
    set_authority{value=255, channel=press_vlv_cmd},
    set_authority{value=100, channel=vent_vlv_cmd},
    0 -> press_vlv_cmd,
    1 -> vent_vlv_cmd
}
```

In this case, `press_vlv_cmd` has absolute authority of 255 and `vent_vlv_cmd` has an
authority of 100.

## Setting Authority in Arc

Arc provides two mechanisms for controlling authority:

**Static declarations** set authority at program startup using the `authority` keyword:

```arc
authority 200

sequence main {
    // all channels written at authority 200
}
```

**Dynamic changes** adjust authority at runtime using `set_authority` inside stages:

```arc
stage escalate {
    set_authority{value=255},
    1 -> press_vlv_cmd
}
```

For full syntax details, see the
[`authority` declaration](/reference/control/arc/reference/syntax#authority-declarations)
and
[`set_authority` built-in](/reference/control/arc/reference/built-ins#set_authority)
reference pages. For practical patterns including emergency override, handoff between
programs, and releasing control, see the
[Control Authority how-to guide](/reference/control/arc/how-to/control-authority).

## Relationship to Manual Control

Manual control of channels through components such as
[Schematics](/reference/console/schematics) follow the same control authority rules as
sequences. Schematic authority is configurable via the schematic toolbar and defaults to
1. When an operator stops controlling a channel from a schematic, any other writer with
higher authority that was already writing to the same channel will resume effective
control.
