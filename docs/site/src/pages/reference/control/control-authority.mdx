When operating multi-device hardware systems that also require manual control through
operators, understanding which entities have control over actuators in a system is
essential. Synnax's control authority & handoff mechanisms allows for smooth
multi-operator and multi-automation interaction.

## Sequence Control Authority

Every entity that writes to Synnax has an assigned control authority for every channel
that it is writing to. Each authority has a number between `0` and `255`, where `0` is the
lowest authority and `255` is the highest (typically referred to as absolute control).

When a sequence is started (whether Python or Embedded), it assigns a control authority
to each channel that it is writing to. If an existing sequence is already writing to a
channel, the new sequence will take control of the channel from the existing sequence
if its authority is higher. If not, the new sequence will not be allowed to write to the
channel until the existing sequence releases control.

In the case of equal authority, the first sequence to take control will maintain control
of the channel.

## Mixed Authorities

It's important to note that a sequence may have different control authorities for
different channels. For example, we may dynamically change the authority of a channel
based on a certain step in a sequence:

```lua
-- abort condition met
if pressure > 100 then
    set_authority("press_vlv_cmd", 255)
    set_authority("vent_vlv_cmd", 100)
    set("press_vlv_cmd", false)
    set("vent_vlv_cmd", true)
end
```

In this case, the `press_vlv_cmd` channel will have an authority of `255` and the
`vent_vlv_cmd` channel will have an authority of `100`.

## Relationship to Manual Control

Manual control of channels through components such as
[Schematics](/reference/console/schematics) follow the same control authority rules as
sequences. This allows for operators to take manual control over channels if/when
necessary.
