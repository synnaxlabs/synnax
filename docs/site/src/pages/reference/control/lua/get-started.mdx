Synnax's embedded sequence editor allows you to write, test, and run tightly
controlled automations directly within the Synnax Console.

Synnax's control sequences are written in the [Lua]() language. If you're not
familiar with Lua, don't worry. The syntax is very simple, and you'll only need
to use a simple set of keywords for most sequences.

## Creating a New Sequence

There are two ways to create a new control sequence. The first is by creating a new
layout through the Synnax mosaic and choosing "Control Sequence" as the component type:

// TODO: INSERT VID

The second is through the command palette, which you can open using `Cmd + Shift + P'
on Mac and 'Ctrl + Shift + P' on Windows.

// TODO: INSERT VID

## Structure of a Sequence

Once you've created a sequence, you'll see a large area for editing text at the top and
a set of configuration fields at the bottom.

### The Editor

The editing area at the top of the dialog is where you'll write the body of your
sequence, including conditional sequence. **Synnax control sequences are executed in
precisely timed, fixed rate loops**.

If you set the sequence rate at 1Hz, the code you write inside of this editor will be
executed once every second.

### Configuration Parameters

In addition to the main sequence body, there are a number of important fields for
configuring sequence parameters.

#### Location

This sets the [driver]() that the sequence will be executed on.

#### Rate

This sets the rate at which the body of the sequence will be executed. For example, a
rate at 10hz will execute your code 10 times per second .

#### Read From

The list of channels that we need to read values from in order to make control decisions
from our sequence. An example could be a set of pressure transducers to determine when
to open and close a valve.

As you edit code within the body of the sequence, Synnax will suggest channels that
match the variable you're typing. If you choose to accept the suggestion, it will be
automatically populated into this field.

#### Write To

The list of channels that we'd like to control within our sequence. For example, these
could be digital output channels that actuate a valve.

## Where are sequences actually run?
