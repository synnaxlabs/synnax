Arc is Synnax's automation language for hardware control. If you've been using Synnax to
acquire data and control hardware manually through schematics, Arc lets you automate
those procedures.

Think of it as writing down the steps you would perform manually: open this valve when
pressure reaches 500 PSI, close it when temperature exceeds 300 degrees, then wait 30
seconds and move to the next step. Arc executes these procedures automatically while you
monitor from the Console.

## Who Arc is For

Arc is designed for **test engineers and control system operators** who understand what
they want to accomplish but need a way to express it in code. If you're coming from:

- **LabVIEW or visual programming tools**: Arc's syntax is more concise than block
  diagrams, and you don't need deep programming experience to use it
- **PLC configuration (Rockwell, Siemens)**: Arc handles automation logic similar to
  function blocks, but integrated directly with Synnax telemetry
- **Manual control through Synnax schematics**: Arc automates the button clicks and
  valve toggles you've been doing by hand

You don't need to be a software developer. If you understand valves, pressure
transducers, and control loops, you already know _what_ to automate. Arc teaches you
_how_ to express it.

## Graph Mode vs Text Mode

When you create an Arc automation, you choose between two editor modes:

### Graph Mode

A visual, block-based editor where you drag and connect nodes. Good for:

- Simple threshold alarms ("alert when pressure > 500")
- Basic on/off control
- Quick prototyping without writing code
- Users who prefer visual programming

### Text Mode

A code editor where you write Arc syntax directly. Good for:

- Multi-step test sequences with multiple stages
- Complex logic with many conditions
- Reusable functions across automations
- Users comfortable with text-based configuration

**Which should you use?** Start with Graph mode for simple automations. Move to Text
mode when you need sequences, stateful logic, or want more control over the automation
structure.

  This documentation focuses on Text mode. Graph mode documentation is coming soon.

## What Arc Does Differently

Unlike traditional programming where you write loops to poll sensors, Arc is
**reactive**. You declare what should happen when data changes, and Arc handles the
rest.

Instead of:

```python
# Traditional approach
while True:
    pressure = read_sensor("tank_pressure")
    scaled = pressure * 2.0
    write_channel("pressure_display", scaled)
    sleep(0.1)
```

You write:

```arc
// Arc approach
tank_pressure * 2.0 -> pressure_display
```

Arc monitors `tank_pressure` for you. When it updates, the computation runs
automatically. No loops, no polling, no timing code.

This reactive model is particularly useful for:

- **Test sequences** where you progress through stages based on conditions
- **Safety monitoring** where multiple conditions must be checked simultaneously
- **Data transformations** where sensor values need scaling or filtering

## Before You Start

Arc builds on Synnax concepts you likely already know:

- **Channels**: Arc reads from and writes to Synnax channels
- **Drivers**: Arc automations run on a driver process
- **Schematics**: Buttons in schematics can trigger Arc sequences

If you're not familiar with these, see:

- [Channels](/reference/concepts/channels) for creating and naming channels
- [Drivers](/reference/driver/get-started) for setting up hardware connections
- [Schematics](/reference/console/schematics) for building control interfaces
