There are several examples written to demonstrate the use of control sequences in
Synnax.

| [Press](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/control/press)                     | A simulated tank pressurization sequence.                                                                                           |
| [Tank Pressurization Control](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/control/tpc) | A set of control sequences for automatic tank pressurization, which include sequences for automated analysis and test optimization. |
| [Abort Sequence](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/control/abort)            | A pair of control sequences that show a normal sequence and an abort sequence that takes control when certain conditions are met.   |
| [Simulators](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/simulators)                   | Reusable SimDAQ base class and hardware simulators for testing control sequences without physical hardware.                         |
