The [Synnax Python client](/reference/python-client/get-started)'s `control` module
makes it easy to write automated sequences to control your hardware. The Synnax team
focuses on making this module as simple as possible - this page will guide you through
the process of writing your first control sequence.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start writing control sequences, you'll need to have:

- A Synnax [Core](/reference/core/quick-start) running
- The Synnax [Python client](/reference/python-client/get-started) installed

## Opening a Controller

The `Controller` class is the main entry point for writing control sequences. At the
start of your script, you'll need to open a controller using the `control.acquire`
method on the Synnax client. This is best done using a context manager, as shown below:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Open the client
client = sy.Synnax()

# Open the controller
with client.control.acquire(
    read=["temperature", "daq_do_1_state"],
    write=["daq_do_1_cmd"]
    write_authorities=[sy.Authority.ABSOLUTE]
) as controller:
    # Your control sequence here
```

The `acquire` method takes a few arguments:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Argument</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`read`</td>
      <td>
        A list of channels that your control sequence will need to read from. Any
        channels not present in this list will not be available to your control
        sequence.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`write`</td>
      <td>
        A list of channels that your sequence needs control over. Any channels not in
        this list cannot be commanded
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`write_authorities`</td>
      <td>
        An optional authority or list of authorities for the channels you're writing to.
        These are numbers between 0 and 255 that define the precedence of your sequence
        over other sequences that may be running. If you don't provide this argument,
        the default authority takes absolute control (255). More on authorities later.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Commanding a Channel

The simplest way to command a channel is to access it as a dictionary key on the
controller and assign a value to it.

```python
with client.control.acquire(
    read=["pressure_1", "daq_do_1_state"],
    write=["daq_do_1_cmd"]
    write_authorities=[sy.Authority.ABSOLUTE]
) as controller:
    # Set a 1 on the digital output channel
    controller["daq_do_1_cmd"] = 1
```

Synnax will also automatically handle the conversion of values to the correct type for
the channel, so a `True` value will be converted to `1` for a digital output channel:

```python
controller["daq_do_1_cmd"] = True
```

When commanding multiple channels, you can use multiple assignments:

```python
controller["daq_do_1_cmd"] = 1
controller["daq_do_2_cmd"] = 0
```

The controller will send each of these commands to the hardware in sequence. If you'd
like to send multiple commands at once, you can use the `set` method:

```python
controller.set({
    "daq_do_1_cmd": True,
    "daq_do_2_cmd": False,
})
```

## Waiting for a Condition

The `wait_until` method allows you to wait for a condition to be met before continuing.
This method accepts a function that takes in the current sensor values and returns a
boolean.

### Lambda Expressions

We recommend relying on `lambda` expressions to keep your code simple. A lambda
expression is a simple way to define a function in one line. Here's an example of a
function that returns `True` if the pressure sensor value is above 25:

```python
# This function returns True if the pressure sensor value is above 25
def temperature_above_25(sensor_values):
    return sensor_values["pressure_1"] > 25

# This is the same function as a lambda expression
temperature_above_25 = lambda sensor_values: sensor_values["pressure_1"] > 25
```

In future examples, we'll use `sv` as a shorthand for `sensor_values` to keep the code
concise. Here's how you can use a similar `lambda` expression with the `wait_until`
method:

```python
with client.control.acquire(
    read=["pressure_1", "daq_do_1_state"],
    write=["daq_do_1_cmd"]
    write_authorities=[sy.Authority.ABSOLUTE]
) as controller:
    # Wait until the pressure sensor value is above 25
    controller.wait_until(lambda sv: sv["pressure_1"] > 25)
```

### Adding a Timeout

The `wait_until` method will continuously check the condition on every new value until
it returns `True`. If you'd like to add a timeout to the wait, you can pass in a
`timeout` argument:

```python
controller.wait_until(lambda sv: sv["pressure_1"] > 25, timeout=10)
```

You can check whether a condition timed out by checking the return value of the
`wait_until` method:

```python
timed_out = controller.wait_until(lambda sv: sv["pressure_1"] > 25, timeout=10)
if timed_out:
    print("The condition timed out")
```

## Blocking While a Condition is True

The `wait_while` method allows you to block the control sequence until a condition is no
longer true. This method is useful for waiting for a sensor value to reach a certain
point before continuing. Here's an example of how you can use the `wait_while` method:

```python
with client.control.acquire(
    read=["pressure_1", "daq_do_1_state"],
    write=["daq_do_1_cmd"]
    write_authorities=[sy.Authority.ABSOLUTE]
) as controller:
    # Wait until the pressure sensor value is above 25
    controller.wait_while(lambda sv: sv["pressure_1"] < 25)
```

In many ways, you can think of the `wait_while` method as the opposite of the
`wait_until` method.

## Asserting a Condition Remains True

The `remains_true_for` method allows you to assert that a condition remains true for a
certain duration. This method is useful for ensuring that a sensor value remains within
a certain range for a period of time. Here's an example of how you can use the
`remains_true_for` method:

```python
with client.control.acquire(
    read=["pressure_1", "daq_do_1_state"],
    write=["daq_do_1_cmd"]
    write_authorities=[sy.Authority.ABSOLUTE]
) as controller:
    # Assert that the pressure sensor value remains above 25 for 10 seconds
    controller.remains_true_for(lambda sv: sv["pressure_1"] > 25, duration=10)
```

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  The `duration` argument should be treated as a minimum duration, as the block is not
  guaranteed to sleep for exactly the provided duration. The actual duration may be
  longer due to the operating system's scheduler. This block will _not_ sleep for less
  than the provided duration unless the condition is no longer true.
</Note.Note>

### Remains True for a Certain Percentage of Samples

The `remains_true_for` method also accepts a `percentage` argument, which is a decimal
value that allows you to specify the percentage of samples that must meet the condition.
This is useful for ensuring that a sensor value remains within a certain range for at
least a certain percentage of the duration. Here's an example of how you can use the
`percentage` argument:

```python
with client.control.acquire(
    read=["pressure_1", "daq_do_1_state"],
    write=["daq_do_1_cmd"]
    write_authorities=[sy.Authority.ABSOLUTE]
) as controller:
    # Assert that the pressure sensor value remains above 25 for 10 seconds
    # for at least 90% of the samples
    controller.remains_true_for(
        lambda sv: sv["pressure_1"] > 25,
        duration=10,
        percentage=0.9
    )
```
