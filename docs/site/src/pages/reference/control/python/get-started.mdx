Synnax allows you to control hardware both manually through our
[operator console](/reference/console/get-started) and programmatically through our
Python control module.

## Using Channels for Control

Synnax controls hardware through its channel streaming system. In Synnax, channels are
simply pipes that pass samples from one place to another. Internally, Synnax treats
channels that are used for data acquisition and channels used for control the same way.
While this may seem strange at first, it allows for high-degrees of flexibility in how
your configure your system.

If you haven't already, we recommend that you read the
[channels](/reference/concepts/channels) documentation to get a better understanding of
just what channels are.

## Basic Control Flow

Control flow in Synnax typically requires two types of channels: a command and a state
channel. Command channels, typically suffixed with `_cmd`, are used to send commands to
the device. State channels, suffixed with `_state`, are used as acknowledgements from a
device driver that a command has been executed.

To illustrate this, consider a simple where we're commanding a digital output on a device
with the name `daq`. We'd create a command channel called `daq_do_1_cmd` with a data type of
`uint8` and a state channel called `daq_do_1_state`, also with a data type of `uint8`.

If you're using one of Synnax's [built-in device drivers](/reference/device-drivers/get-started),
these channels will be created automatically when you start a control/digital output task.

The following diagram illustrates what a basic control flow might look like when
commanding the digital output from a Python script:

The general flow is as follows:

1. The Python script writes the command value of `1` to the `daq_do_1_cmd` channel.
2. The Synnax database node receives the command value and forwards it to a device
   driver. This device driver can be either Synnax's built-in driver or a driver for a custom
   device.
3. The device driver receives and executes the command, sending an acknowledgement value
   of `1` to the `daq_do_1_state` channel.
4. The Synnax database node receives the state value and forwards it to the Python script.
5. The Python script acknowledges the state value and continues executing.
