Control sequences are the primary means for automating hardware operations in your
Synnax deployment. They provide a systematic way to control actuators and other
mechanisms. On this page, we'll explore the different types of control sequences
available within Synnax.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Control Sequence Types

There are two ways to write control sequences in Synnax: via our [Python
Client](/reference/python-client/get-started) and our [Embedded Sequence
Editor](/reference/control/embedded/get-started).

Python control sequences are ideal for complex automations requiring a high degree of
customization. Embedded control sequences are simple, but can be run on real-time OSs
such as National Instruments cRIOs through our [NI Linux Real-Time
Driver](/reference/device-drivers/standalone?platform=ni-linux-rt). Embedded control
sequences can be edited and deployed directly from within the [Synnax
Console](/reference/console/get-started).

## How Control Sequences Work

Both our Python and embedded sequencing systems use the same conceptual approach to
control. Control sequences [stream data](/reference/concepts/streams) from a set
of input channels, perform some computations, and [write
data](/reference/concepts/writes) to a set of output channels.

A control sequence is just a process, such as a Python script or a loop, that [streams
data](/reference/concepts/streams) from a set of input channels, performs some
computation, and [writes data](/reference/concepts/writes) to a set of output channels.

```lua
--- This code block runs 10 times per second.

--- Check if the current pressure is below the threshold.
if pressure < 100 then
    --- If so, open the valve.
    set("press_vlv_cmd", true)
else
    --- Otherwise, close the valve.
    set("press_vlv_cmd", false)
end
```

There is no mention of hardware configuration in this sequence.
Parameters like acquisition rates, scaling, and other hardware specific details are
kept independent from sequencing mechanisms. This allows for a high degree of
flexibility, including the ability to move and change hardware without changing the
control sequence algorithms.

### Example Deployment

To illustrate how control sequences fit into a larger system, here's an example Synnax
deployment that communicates with National Instruments devices:
