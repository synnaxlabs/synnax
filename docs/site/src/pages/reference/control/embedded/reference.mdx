## Reading Channel Values

Reading channel values is as simple as typing the name of the channel you wish to read
as a variable. For example, if we have a channel called `my_channel`, we can read its
value as follows:

```lua
if my_channel > 100 then
end
```

During each sequence step, the value of `my_channel` will be updated with the latest
value from the channel.

## Writing Channel Values

Writing to a channel can be done by calling the `set` function with the channel name
and value. For example, if we have a channel called `my_channel`, we can write to it
as follows:

```lua
set("my_channel", 100)
```

The sequence editor's auto-complete will make sure to add the channel to the "Write To"
list of channels for the sequence. Make sure every channel you'd like to write to is in
the list by checking the dialog at the bottom of the editor.

## Control Authority

The embedded sequence editor allows you to set the control authority of a channel at
arbitrary points in the sequence. This is particularly useful for [abort
sequences](/reference/control/embedded/recipes#abort-sequence) where you'll need to
seize control of a set of channels from one or more separate sequences.

To set the control authority of a channel, use the `set_authority` function with the
channel name and the desired authority. For example, if we have a channel called
`my_channel`, we can set its authority to 100 as follows:

```lua
set_authority("my_channel", 100)
```

Here's a basic example of an abort sequence that seizes control of a set of channels
from two separate sequences:

```lua
-- take absolute control of the channel
if pressure > 100 then
    set_authority("my_channel", 255)
    set("my_channel", false)
end
```

## Timing Utilities

The embedded sequences provide several utilities for timing events.

### Iteration

The global `iteration` variable is automatically incremented each time the sequence is
run. This can be used to initialize variables during the first iteration of the
sequence, or to define control logic that executes for a specific number of iterations.

### Elapsed Time

The global `elapsed_time` variable is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the
sequence started. Keep in mind that this value does not strictly follow the `increment *
rate` rate. So `elapsed_time` for a sequence that runs at 1 Hz and is at iteration 10
will be very close to, but not exactly 10 seconds.

### Elapsed Time Within

The `elapsed_time_within` function returns true if the the current `elapsed_time` is
within a certain range of values. For example, if we want to check if somewhere between
10 and 11 seconds have elapsed, we can do the following:

```lua
if elapsed_time_within(10, 11) then
    -- do something
end
```
