This page walks you through what channels are, their important properties, and how to
use them when in your Core.

If you’re looking for a practical guide on creating or retrieving channels, visit the
respective pages for the [Python](/reference/python-client/channels) and
[TypeScript](/reference/typescript-client/channels) clients.

## Introduction

A channel is a logical collection of samples representing the values of a single source.
This source is typically a sensor, although channels can also hold actuator commands,
post-processed results, or any other time-ordered data.

Channels are used for both **data storage** and **real-time communication**. A sensor
recording samples 25 times per second (or 25Hz) would write data to a channel in order
to store it permanently within Synnax, while at the same time streaming the data for
live consumption.

The following diagram shows a sensor writing samples to a channel, which are then stored
and forwarded to a visualization tool and analysis script.

Channels are comparable to **tags** in a time-series database like
[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) or SCADA system like
[Ignition](https://inductiveautomation.com/). It's common for a single Synnax database
to have hundreds or thousands of channels, each of which represents a different data
source.

## Channel Types

There are three different types of channels in Synnax. **Index** channels exclusively
store timestamps, and are used to retrieve the samples in data channels. **Data**
channels store actual telemetry values, such as sensor readings. **Virtual** channels
are only used for data streaming, and do not persist their samples to the database.

### Index Channels

An **index** channel (or just _index_) is a special type of channel optimized for fast
lookups on timestamps. Index channels always have a data type of `timestamp`, meaning
that they must contain ordered `int64` nanosecond UTC timestamps.

These channels are comparable to the index in a book. To find a particular piece of
information, you first look through the index, which then points you to the relevant
page. In Synnax, index channels are used in a similar fashion. To find the samples in a
data channel for a particular time range, Synnax will first look through the index
channel to find the relevant timestamps, and then retrieve the samples from the data
channel.

### Data Channels

Data channels are the primary method for storing telemetry samples in Synnax. Data
channels can store sensor readings, actuator commands, calculated values, or any other
time-ordered points.

Every sample in a data channel must have the same, fixed size data type. This means that
data channels cannot store variable length values, such as strings or JSON objects.

Every data channel must have an associated index channel, which is used to look up
samples at a particular time. It's common to have multiple data channels associated with
a single index channel.

### Virtual Channels

Virtual channels are only used for real-time data streaming. Their values are not
persisted to disk. Virtual channels do not have an associated index channel, and have
the benefit of being able to support variable length data types.

It's common to send strings, logs, JSON values, or other complex data types over virtual
channels.

## Channel Fields

All channel types have a common set of fields. There may be slight variations in the
naming conventions between the various Synnax client libraries, but the core concepts
remain the same.

### Key

A channel's key is a single, 32-bit number that is automatically assigned by Synnax when
the channel is created. This key uniquely identifies the channel within the database,
and cannot be edited.

### Name

A human-readable name for the channel. This is the most common way to search for and
reference a channel. Synnax does not prevent duplicate names, although it is highly
recommended that you keep them unique.

### Data Type

All channel's must have a consistent data type. Index channels must always have a data
type of `timestamp`, while data channels can have any of the following types:

| Data Type   | Description                   | Size    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| `bool`      | Boolean value                 | 1 byte  |
| `int8`      | Signed 8-bit integer          | 1 byte  |
| `int16`     | Signed 16-bit integer         | 2 bytes |
| `int32`     | Signed 32-bit integer         | 4 bytes |
| `int64`     | Signed 64-bit integer         | 8 bytes |
| `uint8`     | Unsigned 8-bit integer        | 1 byte  |
| `uint16`    | Unsigned 16-bit integer       | 2 bytes |
| `uint32`    | Unsigned 32-bit integer       | 4 bytes |
| `uint64`    | Unsigned 64-bit integer       | 8 bytes |
| `timestamp` | 64-bit nanosecond UTC integer | 8 bytes |
| `float32`   | 32-bit floating point         | 4 bytes |
| `float64`   | 64-bit floating point         | 8 bytes |

In addition to these basic types, virtual channels also support the following variable
length data types:

| Data Type | Description                                                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string`  | UTF-8 string                                                                  |
| `json`    | JSON object                                                                   |
| `uuid`    | [Universally Unique IDentifiers](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html) |

### Is Index

A boolean field indicating whether the channel should be treated as an index channel.
This field defaults to `false`, and should only be set to `true` for index channels. All
index channels have a data type of `timestamp`.

### Virtual

A boolean field indicating whether the channel is virtual. Virtual channels cannot be
indexes. This field defaults to `false`, and should only be set to `true` for virtual
channels.

### Index

This field is only used for data channels, and specifies the key of the index channel
associated with the data channel. This field will be ignored for index and virtual
channels.

### Expression

The expression field is only used for
[calculated channels](/reference/console/calculated-channels). This expression is an Arc
string that calculates what value should be written to the channel and returns it with
`return`. Channel dependencies are automatically detected from the expression.
