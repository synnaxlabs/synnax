This page walks you through what channels are, their important properties, and
how to use them when structuring your cluster.

If you’re looking for a practical guide on creating or retrieving channels,
visit the respective pages for the [Python](../python-client/channels) and
[TypeScript](../typescript-client/channels) clients.

## What is a Channel?

A channel is a logical collection of samples emitted by or representing the
values of a single source. Practically, a channel holds sensor data such as
speedometer, pressure transducer, or memory usage readings. It can also hold
post-processed results such as the noise-filtered signal of another channel. The
only restrictions are that samples in a channel must be time-ordered and share
the same data type.

## A Brief Primer on Domains

Channel data is stored in regions of continuously written samples called
domains. A domain is marked by a time range, where the starting point is the
timestamp of the first sample in the domain, and the ending point is the
timestamp of the last sample.

Domains are used to identify and separate periods of continuous recording, and
typically correlate to different tests or experiments run over the course of
several hours, weeks, or years. It’s common for channels to have thousands or
even millions of domains.

Domains are covered in detail [here](write), although this introduction
should be enough for the subsequent sections.

## Channel Types

Synnax is a time-series database. Every respective channel must have a time
channel that it is indexed to. These index channels allow for data lookup at a
particular time. There are two main types of channels:

1. Indexed Channels - Stores data arriving at a variable rate. The samples in
   these channels are ‘indexed’ by a specified index channel.
2. Index Channels - Stores the timestamps for samples in one or more indexed
   channels. The samples in these channels must be time-ordered, nanosecond
   integers. Timestamps in index channels are used to look up the samples in the
   channels ‘indexed’ by them.

An index channel (or just “index”) is a special type of channel optimized for
fast lookups on timestamps. The values in an indexed channel must be
time-ordered, `int64` nanosecond UTC timestamps. Synnax provides utilities for
converting between timestamp formats and timezones.

Indexed channels are ‘indexed’ by the values in an index channel, which means
that each sample in the indexed channel has a correlated timestamp in its index.
Multiple indexed channels can have the same channel as their index. By
efficiently finding the location of the timestamp, Synnax can also quickly
retrieve the associated samples.

Index channels play a similar role to primary keys in relational databases. The
primary key (in Synnax’s case, a timestamp) can be used to fetch related values
in one or more columns quickly.

## Channel Fields

### Key

A channel’s key is auto-assigned by the cluster and is guaranteed to be unique.

### Name

A human-readable name for the channel. Synnax does not prevent duplicate names,
but we highly recommend that you keep them unique.

{/* Is the above still true? */}

### Data Type

The data type of the samples stored in the channel. A channel’s data type must
have a fixed **density** i.e. the number of bytes per sample is constant. Synnax
has a number of built in data types:

| Data Type   | Description                   | Density |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| `bool`      | Boolean value                 | 1 byte  |
| `int8`      | Signed 8-bit integer          | 1 byte  |
| `int16`     | Signed 16-bit integer         | 2 bytes |
| `int32`     | Signed 32-bit integer         | 4 bytes |
| `int64`     | Signed 64-bit integer         | 8 bytes |
| `uint8`     | Unsigned 8-bit integer        | 1 byte  |
| `uint16`    | Unsigned 16-bit integer       | 2 bytes |
| `uint32`    | Unsigned 32-bit integer       | 4 bytes |
| `uint64`    | Unsigned 64-bit integer       | 8 bytes |
| `timestamp` | 64-bit nanosecond UTC integer | 8 bytes |
| `float32`   | 32-bit floating point         | 4 bytes |
| `float64`   | 64-bit floating point         | 8 bytes |

We’re also planning on adding support for custom data types such as fixed-size
JSON objects and arrays. If this is something that interests you, let us know.

### Is Index

If this value is true, the channel is considered an index channel. Index
channels must have a data type of `timestamp`, meaning that they must contain
ordered `int64` nanosecond UTC timestamps.

### Index

If the channel is not an index channel, this should be set to the key of the
index channel. If this parameter is provided, the channel is considered an
indexed channel. This field will be ignored for index channels, as they cannot
be indexed.
