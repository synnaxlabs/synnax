## What is a Node?

A node is a single, running instance of the Synnax executable. A node can be deployed on
an edge server to acquire data from sensors in the field, run in a local environment for
development, or be deployed in the cloud for high performance analysis.

## What is a Cluster?

Multiple nodes join together to form a cluster. These nodes constantly communicate with
each other to coordinate operations across the cluster. Through this communication, the
nodes expose the cluster as a monolithic data space. This means that a user can query
any node and have access to all of the cluster's data and compute.

The smallest Synnax cluster contains a single node. This works well for testing and
development. We recommend running larger clusters for production.

## Cluster Topology

### Reachable Addresses and IDs

Nodes are uniquely identified by both a reachable address and an ID. A node's address
allows clients and other nodes to communicate with it. Synnax multiplexes client and
node communication over the same port.

A node's ID is a 16-bit integer that uniquely identifies it within the cluster. The
first node in the cluster, called the bootstrap node, is assigned the ID 1. Subsquent
nodes are assigned IDs through a process called pledging. Even if a node permanently
leaves the cluster, it's ID will not be reassigned. Node ID's are used to generate
cluster-wide unique ID's for components such as [channels](/reference/concepts/channels)
as well as synchronizing operations across the cluster.

### Heartbeats and Gossip

Nodes use a
[gossip protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol#:~:text=A%20gossip%20protocol%20or%20eschematicemic,all%20members%20of%20a%20group.)
to continuously exchange information about the cluster topology. Each node gossips with
a pseudo-randomly chosen node, called a _peer_, on a one second interval. Each time a
node gossips, it increments a counter, called a heartbeat, and sends it along with its
current view of the cluster topology. The node and its peer then compare their
topologies and merge them.

Heartbeats play an important role in failure detection and response.
