## What is a Node?

A node is a single, running instance of the Synnax executable. A node can be
deployed on an edge server to acquire data from sensors in the field, run in a
local environment for development, or be deployed in the cloud for high
performance analysis.

## What is a Cluster?

Multiple nodes join together to form a cluster. These nodes constantly
communicate with each other to coordinate operations across the cluster. Through
this communication, the nodes expose the cluster as a monolithic data space.
This means that a user can query any node and have access to all of the
cluster's data and compute.

The smallest Synnax cluster contains a single node. This works well for testing
and development. We recommend running larger clusters for production.

## Cluster Topology

### Reachable Addresses and IDs

Nodes are uniquely identified by both a reachable address and an ID. A node's
address allows clients and other nodes to communicate with it. Synnax
multiplexes client and node communication over the same port.

A node's ID is a 16-bit integer that uniquely identifies it within the cluster.
The first node in the cluster, called the bootstrap node, is assigned the ID 1.
Subsquent nodes are assigned IDs through a process called pledging. Even if a
node permanently leaves the cluster, it's ID will not be reassigned. Node ID's
are used to generate cluster-wide unique ID's for components such as
[channels](channels) as well as synchronizing operations across the cluster.

### Heartbeats and Gossip

Nodes use a [gossip protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol#:~:text=A%20gossip%20protocol%20or%20eschematicemic,all%20members%20of%20a%20group.)
to continuously exchange information about the cluster topology. Each node
gossips with a pseudo-randomly chosen node, called a _peer_, on a one second
interval. Each time a node gossips, it increments a counter, called a heartbeat,
and sends it along with its current view of the cluster topology. The node and
its peer then compare their topologies and merge them.

Heartbeats play an important role in failure detection and response.
