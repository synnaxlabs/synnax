This page walks you through the lifecycle of a read operation. If you'd like a practical
guide on reading data using a client library, take a look at the respective pages for
[Python](/reference/python-client/read-data) and
[TypeScript](/reference/typescript-client/read-data).

### Range Inclusivity

It's important to note that ranges are start **inclusive** and end **exclusive**. For
example, if our desired range is from `1677433720970863400` to `1677433721870863400`, we
would retrieve the following subset from the shown domain:

<Table
  client:only="react"
  columns={[
    { key: "time" },
    { key: "thermocouple-01" },
    { key: "strain-gauge-01" },
    { key: "pressure-transducer-05" },
  ]}
  highlights={[
    {
      key: "one",
      columns: ["time", "thermocouple-01", "strain-gauge-01", "pressure-transducer-05"],
      color: "var(--pluto-primary-z)",
      rows: { lower: 1, upper: 4 },
    },
  ]}
  data={[
    {
      time: 1677433720770863800,
      "thermocouple-01": 19.2,
      "strain-gauge-01": 350.78,
      "pressure-transducer-05": 19.22,
    },
    {
      time: 1677433720970863400,
      "thermocouple-01": 19.2,
      "strain-gauge-01": 350.78,
      "pressure-transducer-05": 19.22,
    },
    {
      time: 1677433721270868900,
      "thermocouple-01": 19.2,
      "strain-gauge-01": 350.78,
      "pressure-transducer-05": 19.22,
    },
    {
      time: 1677433721470863800,
      "thermocouple-01": 19.2,
      "strain-gauge-01": 350.78,
      "pressure-transducer-05": 19.22,
    },
    {
      time: 1677433721870863400,
      "thermocouple-01": 19.2,
      "strain-gauge-01": 350.78,
      "pressure-transducer-05": 19.22,
    },
  ]}

## Iterators

Underneath every read operation is an iterator. An iterator allows the caller to
traverse through a range of data in a streaming fashion. Iterators are more complex to
work with, so we recommend using a single request-response read when possible.

Just like a read, an iterator can be created by providing a range and a list of
channels. Creating an iterator will not return any data, but will instead open a
persistent connection to the Core. You can then perform two categories of operation:
seeking and reading.

### Validity

Iterator's maintain a validity state throughout their lifetime. This flag is used to
indicate whether the iterator is healthy and has more data to read. An iterator is
considered _invalid_ if it:

1. Has accumulated an error. This typically happens when the iterator is unable to reach
   the Core.
2. Is not pointing at a valid sample. This can occur if the iterator has:
   - Exhausted its data, meaning the end of the range is reached during forward
     iteration, or the start of the range is reached during reverse iteration.
   - Has not been positioned yet with a seeking call.

An iterator that has been opened but not yet positioned is invalid. To position the
iterator, you must call a seeking operation.

### Seeking

Seeking moves the iterator to a new position in the range. All seeking calls return a
`boolean` indicating the validity state after executing the operation.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 130px;">Operation</th>
      <th style="width: 100px;">Arguments</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`seek-lt`</td>
      <td>timestamp</td>
      {/* prettier-ignore */}
      <td>Seeks to the first sample whose timestamp is strictly less than the
                provided timestamp.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`seek-ge`</td>
      <td>timestamp</td>
      {/* prettier-ignore */}
      <td>Seeks to the first sample whose timestamp is greater than or equal to
            the provided timestamp.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`seek-first`</td>
      <td>None</td>
      <td>Seeks to the first sample in the range.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`seek-last`</td>
      <td>None</td>
      <td>Seeks to the last sample in the range.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Seeking calls can be used to **revalidate** an iterator after it has been exhausted or
positioned to an invalid location. In the case of an accumulated error, this call may or
may not succeed.

### Reading

There are two methods for reading from an iterator. The first is through a fixed number
of samples called the **chunk size**, which can be set when creating the iterator. Each
call to `next` or `prev` without any arguments will return the next chunk of data.

The second is by providing a specified timespan to read. This is useful for seeking to
and reading specific sections of data. When using span-based iteration, you should be
wary of reading too large of a span, as this can cause heavy performance degradation.
Reading by a span is start inclusive and end exclusive, regardless of the direction of
iteration.

As with seeking operations, all reads return a `boolean` indicating the validity state
after executing the operation.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Operation</th>
      <th style="width: 180px;">Arguments</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`next`</td>
      <td>timespan or nothing</td>
      {/* prettier-ignore */}
      <td>If no timespan is provided, reads the next frame of data specified by
                the chunk size. If a timespan is provided, reads the next frame of data
                across the span.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`prev`</td>
      <td>timespan or nothng</td>
      {/* prettier-ignore */}
      <td>Reads the previous chunk of data whose timespan is less than or equal to
                the provided timespan. If no timespan is provided, reads the previous
                chunk of data specified by the chunk size.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Accessing the Iterator Value

While read operations _do_ fetch frames from the Core, they do not return them directly.
Instead, the current frame is kept in client-side memory, and can be accessed through
the `value` method on the iterator.

This method returns a frame with the same format as in unary reads. If the iterator is
invalid, calls to `value` have undefined behavior. If the iterator has been positioned
but not yet read from, the frame will be empty.
