A range (short for _time range_) is a named time interval that labels interesting events
in your cluster's data. Ranges are the primary means for organizing and accessing the
data stored within Synnax, and can be used to correlate metadata with channel telemetry.

To create a range, you only need to specify a name, a starting timestamp, and an ending
timestamp. While a range can be used to query the data within a channel, it is not
necessary to specify the channels that belong within a range.

## Metadata

Ranges can store arbitrary pieces of metadata that describe important information about
the events that occurred within that range. Common examples include part numbers, links
to procedures, and configuration information.

The metadata on a range is organized as key-value pairs, where they key is an arbitrary
piece of text (a string), and the value is a link, number, or other data point.

We generally recommend against storing large blobs of information as metadata, such as a
250 kB configuration file, as this can have a negative impact on performance. Instead,
consider storing a link to the configuration file in a cloud storage service or Git
repository.

## Channel Aliases

Sometimes you want to refer to a channel by a different name within the scope of a
range. For example, imagine you're connecting to a device with three analog input
voltage channels: `ai_0`, `ai_1`, and `ai_2`. For an experiment where you're using the
first input to measure pressure in a tank, you might want to refer to the channel as
`tank_pressure`. For a second experiment, you may have the first analog input measuring
temperature, and you'd want to refer to the channel as `temperature`.

_Aliases_ let you configure range-specific names for channels. When you query data
within a range, you can search for the channel by both its original name and its alias.

## Child Ranges

Child ranges can be used to further segment a range into small, specific intervals. If
you have a range that tracks a series of tests for a single component, you can create a
range for all tests (typically called a campaign), and then create child ranges that
identify specific tests within the campaign.

Child ranges inherit the metadata and channel aliases from their parent range, but can
override them within the scope of the child range.

## Snapshots

Snapshots can be used to capture the configuration of a resource and tie it to a range.
The most relevant example is a snapshot of a data acquisition or control
[task](/reference/device-drivers). When you create a snapshot of a task, you're
capturing critical information such as calibrations, scaling values, and mappings to
physical ports and lines. The snapshot provides a permanent way to refer to the
configuration of the task at the time the range was created.

You can also create snapshots of other resources, such as
[schematics](/reference/console/schematics).

## Labels

Labels are a simple way to categorize ranges into groups. They can be used to
differentiate the ranges belonging to a specific process (assembly line or test stand),
identify the status of a range (in progress, completed, success, failure), or any other
category relevant to your team.

## Using Ranges

There are a number of ways to create, access, and modify ranges within Synnax. The
[Python](/reference/python-client/ranges) and TypeScript client libraries provide
programmatic interfaces. Ranges can also be managed in the
[Synnax Console](/reference/console/ranges).
