This page documents the high-level process of writing data to a cluster, including
transactions, streaming/persistence modes, and dynamic control handoff. This page is a
theoretical introduction. For practical guides on writing data using a client library,
see the [Python Client](/reference/python-client/write-data) and

## Introduction

Writing data to Synnax involves sending batches of telemetry samples to a cluster. These
batches are called [frames](/reference/concepts/overview#frames). The primary interface
for writing these frames is, unsurprisingly, a **writer**. Writers are analogous to
pipes that continuously feed a cluster with frames of data for one or more channels.

When ingesting historical data, it's common to quickly write many large frames of
previously recorded values. These frames can contain tens of thousands to millions of
samples. In real-time acquisition scenarios, frames are typically much smaller,
containing one to a few dozen samples per channels. These small frames are repeatedly
written over long periods of time.

### How writers are used in Synnax

There can be many writers open on a single Synnax cluster at once. Each writer can serve
a different purpose. For example, one writer might be responsible for sending incoming
sensor values from a device. Another writer can send control commands to a device with
actuators connected to it.

  />
</Diagram>

Internally, [schematics](/reference/console/schematics) within the Synnax
[console](/reference/console/get-started) use writers to send commands to actuators when
a user clicks on a valve or other control element.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Transactions

Each writer governs an atomic transaction against the Synnax cluster. To begin a
transaction, we open a new writer and start writing data frames using a file like
interface. After we're done writing, we commit the writer to the database, making it
available for reading. Synnax transactions are unique in that they can be committed
**multiple** times, where each new commit extends the data written in the previous
commit. After the final commit, the user closes the writer, at which point the cluster
releases all write-related resources and the transaction is complete.

### Open Phase

To start a new transaction, we need to provide the following information.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Argument</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Channels</td>
      <td>The channels we're interested in writing to.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Timestamp</td>
      {/* prettier-ignore */}
      <td>The timestamp marking the time at or just before the first written
                sample was recorded.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

Synnax will use these arguments to validate two things before opening the writer:

1. That all channels exist in the Synnax cluster.
2. That no existing data overlaps with the provided timestamp.

#### Optional Arguments

There are also a few optional arguments we can provide when opening a writer:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Argument</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="#persistencestreaming-modes">Mode</a>
      </td>
      {/* prettier-ignore */}
      <td>The persistence/streaming mode of the writer. This can be persist only,
                stream only, or stream + persist.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="#dynamic-control---write-authorities">Authority</a>
      </td>
      {/* prettier-ignore */}
      <td>The authority to set for the writer. This is used for dynamic control
                handoff between multiple writers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Auto-Commit</td>
      {/* prettier-ignore */}
      <td>Whether writes should be immediately committed to the Synnax
            Cluster.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

### Write Phase

After all opening validation checks pass, the transaction enters the write phase. During
this period, a user can write continuous frames of data to the transaction. These frames
must be vertical (i.e. all channels must have a single series specified), and all series
must have the same number of samples.

To illustrate how a series of writes would work, imagine we write the following frame:

| time                | my-precise-tc | strain-gauge-01 | pressure-transducer-05 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1677433720770863800 | 19.17         | 344.78          | 16.22                  |
| 1677433720970863400 | 19.18         | 346.78          | 17.22                  |
| 1677433721270868900 | 19.19         | 348.78          | 18.22                  |

After this write, the stored data in the Synnax database transaction looks exactly like
the first frame. Then we write the next frame:

| time                | my-precise-tc | strain-gauge-01 | pressure-transducer-05 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1677433721470863800 | 19.21         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433721870863400 | 19.22         | 352.78          | 20.22                  |
| 1677433721970868900 | 19.23         | 354.78          | 21.22                  |

Now, our transaction looks like this:

| time                | my-precise-tc | strain-gauge-01 | pressure-transducer-05 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1677433720770863800 | 19.17         | 344.78          | 16.22                  |
| 1677433720970863400 | 19.18         | 346.78          | 17.22                  |
| 1677433721270868900 | 19.19         | 348.78          | 18.22                  |
| 1677433721470863800 | 19.21         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433721870863400 | 19.22         | 352.78          | 20.22                  |
| 1677433721970868900 | 19.23         | 354.78          | 21.22                  |

Throughout the write phase, the caller can continue extending the the transaction's data
by adding frames. It's common for writers to be open for many hours or even days.

### Commit Phase

Once we're ready to persist the transaction and make it available for reads, we call the
`commit` method on our writer. During this phase, the cluster identifies the time range
of the writer based on the provided starting timestamp and the samples written. The
commit process succeeds and the write is now available for reads. After this phase
completes, the transaction is moved back into the write phase. At this point, we can
either write more frames to the cluster and commit again, or we can close the writer.

#### Auto-commit

If the writer is configured with auto-commit on, every write is immediately committed
and available for reads. This method is useful for real-time data that does not need to
be applied atomically.

### Close Phase

Once done writing, the user can close the writer and release all of it's resources. All
writes that have not been committed will be lost. Closing a writer will also release
control of the channel to the next highest
[authority](#dynamic-control---write-authorities) writer, if one exists.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Writer Modes

Synnax supports three modes for writing data: persist, stream, and stream-and-persist.

### Persist

When a writer is opened in **persist** mode, the data it writes will not be sent to
streamers listening on the channel being written to. These writers can _not_ be used for
real-time consumption or monitoring. Persist mode is commonly used when writing
historical data to a cluster that doesn't represent the current state of the hardware
system.

### Stream

When opened in **stream** mode, the writer will not commit any written data to the
cluster, and calls to `commit` will have no effect. This is useful when operating in
scenarios where data is only needed for real-time consumption, but does not need to be
accessed historically.

### Stream + Persist

When opened in **stream-and-persist** mode, the writer will both persist the samples and
stream them to any streamers listening on the channel. This is the default mode for a
writer.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Rules of Writes

### Rule 1

<Rule title="Rule 1">
  Index channels must be written to before or when writing to a data channel.
</Rule>

#### Example 1 - Writing to an Index and Data Channel at the Same Time

We've created two channels: `time` and `temperature`. The `temperature` channel is
indexed by the `time` channel. Here's pseudocode for the fields of each channel:

```json
time = {
  "key": 65536,
  "data_type": "timestamp",
  "is_index": true,
}

temperature = {
  "key": 65537,
  "data_type": "float32",
  "is_index": false,
  "index": 65536,
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

When we write to both the `time` and `temperature` channels, we must provide timestamps
for the time channel in the same frame as the temperature channel. This frame is
<b style="color: var(--pluto-secondary-z);">valid</b>.

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

```json
{
  "time": [1677433720770863800, 1677433720970863400, 1677433721270868900],
  "temperature": [19.17, 19.18, 19.19]
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

If we try to write to the `temperature` channel without providing timestamps for the
`time` channel, we violate Rule 1. This frame is
<b style="color: var(--pluto-error-z);">invalid</b>.

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

```json
{
  // The time channel is missing.
  "temperature": [19.17, 19.18, 19.19]
}
```

#### Example 2 - Writing to a Data Channel After an Index Channel

Imagine we create the same channels as in the first example, but this time we only open
a writer on the `time` channel. We write the following frame:

```json
{
  "time": [1677433720770863800, 1677433720970863400, 1677433721270868900]
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

This frame is <b style="color: var(--pluto-secondary-z);">valid</b> because we're only
writing to the `time` channel. Now, we open a writer on the `temperature` channel,
marking its `start` timestamp as `1677433720770863800`. This frame would be
<b style="color: var(--pluto-secondary-z);">valid</b> because we've already written
timestamps to the `time` channel.

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

```json
{
  // Timestamps already exist for each of the following readings.
  "temperature": [19.17, 19.18, 19.19]
}
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  This example is useful for understanding scenarios where you're interested in
  calculating values from one or more data channels, and writing the results to a new
  data channel indexed by the same timestamps.
</Note.Note>

#### Example 3 - Writing to a Data Channel Before an Index Channel

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

If we repeat example 2, but this time we write to the `temperature` channel before the
`time` channel, we violate Rule 1. This frame is
<b style="color: var(--pluto-error-z);">invalid</b> because no timestamps exist to
associate with the temperature samples.

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

```json
{
  // Synnax has no way of relating these samples to a timestamp!
  "temperature": [19.17, 19.18, 19.19]
}
```

### Rule 2

<Rule title="Rule 2">
  Data channels for an index must have the same number of samples.
</Rule>

#### Example 1

We've created three channels: `time`, `temperature`, and `pressure`. Both `pressure` and
`temperature` are indexed by the `time` channel. Here's pseudocode for the fields of
each channel:

```json
time = {
  "key": 65536,
  "data_type": "timestamp",
  "is_index": true,
}

temperature = {
  "key": 65537,
  "data_type": "float32",
  "is_index": false,
  "index": 65536,
}

pressure = {
  "key": 65538,
  "data_type": "float32",
  "is_index": false,
  "index": 65536,
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

When we open a writer on all three channels, we must write frames that contain the same
number of samples for each channel. For example, this frame is
<b style="color: var(--pluto-secondary-z);">valid</b>.

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

```json
{
  "time": [1677433720770863800, 1677433720970863400, 1677433721270868900],
  "temperature": [19.17, 19.18, 19.19],
  "pressure": [16.22, 17.22]
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

Omitting a sample from the `pressure` channel would violate Rule 2. This frame is
<b style="color: var(--pluto-error-z);">invalid</b>.

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

```json
{
  "time": [1677433720770863800, 1677433720970863400, 1677433721270868900],
  "temperature": [19.17, 19.18, 19.19],
  // This series is missing a sample.
  "pressure": [16.22, 17.22]
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

Entirely omitting a channel from the frame would also violate Rule 2. This frame is
<b style="color: var(--pluto-error-z);">invalid</b>.

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

```json
{
  "time": [1677433720770863800, 1677433720970863400, 1677433721270868900],
  "temperature": [19.17, 19.18, 19.19]
  // The pressure channel is missing.
}
```

### Rule 3

<Rule title="Rule 3">

Rules 1 and 2 do not apply to virtual channels.

</Rule>

As [virtual channels](/reference/concepts/channels#virtual-channels) do not store data,
they have far more flexibility in how they can be written to. They do not require
timestamps, and as a result do not need to be associated with an index. Write to them
whenever and however you like!

<Divider.Divider x />

## Rule Implications

While these rules are subtle, they have a few important implications.

### Implication 1

<Rule title="Implication 1">
  All channels that share the same index must be sampled at the same rate.
</Rule>

If you have a temperature and pressure sensor that are recorded by different devices.
The first device records temperature at 10Hz, while the second records pressure at 25Hz.
Pressure and temperature samples will not always share the same timestamp, and by
consequence cannot share the same index.

### Implication 2

<Rule>

Command channels almost always require separate indexes.

</Rule>

Channels that are used to send commands to actuators are typically used quite
differently to channels that record from sensors. It's common for a single device to
sample from many different sensors at the same rate, meaning that these sensor channels
can share an index.

This is rarely the case for command channels. Command channels are typically written to
independently of other command channels (i.e. open one valve, wait a few seconds, then
open another valve). Commands (also considered samples) emitted by these channels almost
never share the same timestamp, and cannot share the same index.

It's almost always necessary to use a separate index for each command channel, or use a
virtual channel that does not require an index.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Dynamic Control - Write Authorities

Synnax supports multi-writer control transfer over a single channel. This enables
patterns such as:

- Handoff between a manual operator and automated system.
- Handoff between multiple manual operators.
- Handoff between multiple automated systems, such as nominal control loops and abort
  sequences.

The control handoff mechanism is based on numeric authorities between 0 and 255, where 0
is the lowest authority and 255 is the highest. When a writer is opened, the user can
specify an authority for all channels in the writer, or for each channel individually.

When multiple writers are open on the same channel, the writer with a higher authority
will have control. If a new writer is opened with a strictly higher authority, it will
take control from the previous writer. After a higher authority writer is closed,
control will be returned to the next highest authority writer.

### Example - Manual Operator & Abort Sequence

To illustrate this, consider the following scenario:

1. Writer A opens on channel `my-channel` with authority 100.
2. Writer B, which listens for abort conditions, opens on channel `my-channel` with
   authority 50. Writer A remains in control.
3. Writer A writes a number of samples to the channel, which commands an actuator.
4. Writer B detects an abort condition and sets its authority to 250. Writer B now takes
   control of the channelData, and moves the system into a safe state.
5. A manual operator (writer C) opens on channel `my-channel` with authority 255, taking
   absolute control of the system to make adjustments.
6. Writers B and C close, returning control to writer A.
