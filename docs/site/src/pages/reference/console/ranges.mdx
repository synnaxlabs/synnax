Ranges are the primary means for organizing and accessing the data stored in a Synnax
cluster. They identify and name a specific time interval, and can be used to correlate
metadata with channel telemetry. If you'd like a conceptual introduction to ranges and
their use cases, visit the [concepts page](/reference/concepts/ranges) on ranges.

## Creating a Range

There are several ways to create ranges in the Synnax Console.

### Using the Range Toolbar

The simplest way to create a new range is by clicking the **create** button in the
range toolbar. This will open a dialog where you can fill in the required fields.

### Using the Command Palette

You can also create a range using the command palette. To open the palette, click on the
search bar at the top and type ">", or press `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on
Windows.

### From a Plot Region

You can also create a range by selecting a region on a plot. This is particularly useful
when you want to annotate a particular event. The range creation dialog will automatically
populate the `From` and `To` fields with the selected region.

## Finding Existing Ranges

There are two primary ways to search for existing ranges in the console: the resources
toolbar and command and search palette.

### Using the Resources Toolbar

The resources toolbar is located on the left side of the console, and can be used to
browse all of your cluster's resources, including ranges. All of your ranges can be
found under the "Ranges" section.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ranges/resources" />

We can load a specific range into our ranges toolbar by clicking on it.

### Command and Search Palette

The command and search palette is located in the top center of the console, and can be
used to search for cluster resources and execute commands. We can find a permanently
saved range just by typing its name into the palette.

Use the arrow keys to navigate the results, and press <Icon.Keyboard.Return /> to load
the range you're interested in. You can also hover and click using your mouse.

## Child Ranges

[Child ranges](/reference/concepts/ranges#child-ranges) are a way to further segment a
range into smaller, specific intervals. The easiest way to create a child range is by
specifying the parent range field in the range creation dialog. You can also create a
child by clicking on the **Add Child Range** button in the range overview page.

## Metadata

You can also attach arbitrary metadata to a range, including links to external
resources. To add a new field, simply click on a cell in the metadata section of the
range overview page.

## Labels

Labels are an effective way to categorize and filter ranges. You can add a label to a
range by clicking on the **Add Label** button in the range overview page.
