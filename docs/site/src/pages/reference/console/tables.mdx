Tables are used to view live telemetry in a tabular format. They can be used for
creating dashboards, viewing data from many different channels, and conditionally
coloring data that exceeds certain thresholds.

## Creating a Table

To create a table, add a new tab and select the table visualization:

You can also create a table by opening the command palette at the top (`Ctrl+Shift+P`
(Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS)) and searching for the "Create a Table" command.

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  Make sure that you are working in an active
  [workspace](/reference/console/workspaces)! If your table is not created in a
  workspace, it will not be saved permanently to Synnax.

## Text Cells

In a table, a text cell can be used to display a line of text. You can also change the
text alignment, text weight, and and text size.

## Value Cells

Value cells functions like values on a schematic. These can be used to display live
data, and automatically update as new data comes in.

### Redlining a Value

You can "redline" a value to change the value's color when the number exceeds a certain
threshold. This is done by clicking the "Redline" tab in the cell's properties. The
lower and upper represent the lower and upper bounds on the value. Selecting a color
determines which color appears when the value passes the threshold.
