Workspaces allow you to save a particular layout for later access and to share with
others. This can be useful for organizing layouts for different tasks, component
configurations, or to collaboratively develop a project.

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  Make sure that you are working in an active workspace! If you are working on a
  visualization like a [schematic](/reference/console/schematics) or [line
  plot](/reference/console/line-plots), your visualization will **not be saved**
  permanently unless you are working in an active workspace.

## Creating a New Workspace

To create a new workspace, use the workspace selector in the top-left corner of the
Console.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/workspaces/create" />

<Divider.Divider x />

## Loading a Workspace

Workspaces can be loaded by finding them in the Workspace toolbars on the left-hand side
or from the Workspaces Dropdown in the top-left corner of the Console.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/workspaces/load" />

## Sharing a Workspace

If you want to share a workspace with someone else, you have two different options:
sharing a workspace with someone connected to the same Synnax Core, or sharing a
workspace via exporting it to a directory file.

### Sharing via Link

To share a workspace by link, find the workspace in the Workspaces Toolbar, right-click
and open the context menu, and then click the "Copy Link" option.

<Image client:only="react" id="console/workspaces/copy-link" />

Anyone with this link that is connected to the Core on their Synnax Console can open the
workspace by pasting the link into a web browser or other application.

### Sharing via File

#### Exporting a workspace

To share a workspace by file, find the workspace in the Workspaces Toolbar, right-click
on it and open the context menu, and then click the "Export" option.

<Image client:only="react" id="console/workspaces/export" />

Alternatively, you can export the current workspace by using the "Export Current
Workspace" command available in the command palette.

The workspace will be saved in a directory, which will include a `LAYOUT.json` file
which describes the layout of the workspace, and other JSON files which describe the
structure of schematics, line plots, and other visualizations in the workspace.

#### Importing a workspace

To import a workspace, you can either call the "Import Workspace" command from the
command palette, or drag and drop a directory containing a `LAYOUT.json` file into the
Synnax Console.
