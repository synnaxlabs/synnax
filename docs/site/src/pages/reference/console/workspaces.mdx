Workspaces allow you to save a particular console layout for later access and to share
with others. This can be useful for organizing your console layouts for different tasks,
component configurations, or to collaboratively develop a project.

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  Make sure that you are working in an active workspace! If you are working on a
  visualization like a [schematic](/reference/console/schematics) or [line
  plot](/reference/console/line-plots), your visualization will not be saved permanently
  unless you are working in an active workspace.

## Creating a New Workspace

To create a new workspace, use the workspace selector in the top-left corner of the
console.

Workspaces can be loaded by finding them in the resources toolbar on the left-hand side
or clicking the workspace tab on the top.
