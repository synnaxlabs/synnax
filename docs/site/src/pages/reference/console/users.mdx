Synnax uses role-based access control (RBAC) to manage what actions different team
members can perform. Each user is assigned a role, and the role determines what
resources the user can view, edit, or delete. This approach makes it easy to manage
permissions for large teams by assigning users to predefined roles rather than
configuring individual permissions.

## Registering Users

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

Users can be added with the "Register a User" command from the command palette in the
top of the Console. The palette can be opened by pressing <Icon.Keyboard.Control /> +
<Icon.Keyboard.Shift /> + `P` (Windows) / <Icon.Keyboard.Command /> +
<Icon.Keyboard.Shift /> + `P` (macOS).

During registration, you can select a role for the new user. The role determines what
permissions the user will have in the system. Afterwards, users can log in to Synnax
using the username and password that was registered for them.

## Built-In Roles

Synnax provides four built-in roles that cover common access patterns. These roles
cannot be deleted or renamed, ensuring a consistent permission structure across your
deployment.

| Role         | Description                                                               | Key Capabilities                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Owner**    | Full control of deployment, including user registration and security      | All actions on all resources; user management; security settings                                                         |
| **Engineer** | Full access to system configuration except user management                | Create/edit channels, workspaces, schematics, line plots, tasks, devices, ranges, tables, Arc code; view users and roles |
| **Operator** | View workspaces and visualizations; control hardware and data acquisition | Control hardware tasks; edit ranges and framers; view all resources; cannot modify system configuration                  |
| **Viewer**   | Read-only access to all resources                                         | View all resources; no edit or delete capabilities                                                                       |

## Assigning Roles

To change a user's role, find the user's username in the Users Toolbar on the left-hand
side of the screen. Right-click the user and select "Assign to role". This opens a
dialog where you can select a role from a dropdown and click "Assign" to save the
change.

You can also assign roles by dragging a user onto the desired role in the resource tree.
This provides a quick way to reassign multiple users to different roles.

There are some restrictions on role assignment. Root users cannot have their roles
changed, which ensures the system always has at least one administrator. Additionally,
users cannot change their own roles, preventing accidental privilege changes.
