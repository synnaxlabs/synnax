## Operating System

The Synnax Console is compatible with Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia or later. While the
Console does work on certain versions of Windows 10, it is not officially supported and
you may experience issues.

## General Hardware Requirements

#### Minimum System Requirements

- **CPU**: Intel Core i5 (8th generation) or AMD Ryzen 5 (3000 series) or equivalent
- **RAM**: 8 GB RAM
- **Storage**: 2 GB available disk space

#### Recommended System Requirements

- **CPU**: Intel Core i7 (10th generation) or AMD Ryzen 7 (4000 series) or better
- **RAM**: 16 GB RAM or more
- **Storage**: 4 GB available disk space (SSD recommended)

## Graphics Requirements

The Synnax Console is **GPU-intensive** due to its real-time data visualization
capabilities, including high-frequency time-series plotting and dense schematics. For
optimal performance, we strongly recommend using a dedicated graphics card.

#### Minimum GPU Requirements

- **Dedicated GPU**: NVIDIA GTX 1030 / AMD RX 550 or equivalent
- **VRAM**: 2 GB
- **DirectX**: Version 12 compatible
- **OpenGL**: Version 4.5 support

#### Recommended GPU Specifications

- **Dedicated GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 2060 / AMD RX 5600 XT or better
- **VRAM**: 6 GB or more
- **DirectX**: Version 12 Ultimate support
- **OpenGL**: Version 4.6 support

#### Integrated Graphics

While the Console can run on integrated graphics (Intel Iris Xe, AMD Radeon Vega),
performance may be significantly reduced, especially when:

- Displaying multiple high-frequency data streams simultaneously
- Working with large datasets or long time ranges
- Editing complex schematics

For production environments or heavy data analysis workflows, a dedicated GPU is
essential for maintaining smooth, responsive performance.

## Display Requirements

We recommend running the Console on a display with a resolution of at least 1920x1080,
although 4K displays are preferred as they provide a far better user experience when
operating the Console for extended periods.
