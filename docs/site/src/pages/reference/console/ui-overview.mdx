The Synnax Console provides a flexible environment to display and interact with data
stored and streamed through a Synnax Core. It's interface is designed around two main UI
elements: the central layout mosaic and side toolbars.

The central mosaic displays visualizations such as line plots and schematics, while the
toolbars exists to provide access to resources, data ranges, tasks, and visualization
controls.

## Toolbars

To kick things off, we'll walk you through each of the toolbars and their functionality.

### <Icon.Resources /> Resources

The resource toolbar displays a file tree with folders for channels, ranges, users, and
workspaces.

## Mosaic

Synnax can be easily manipulated to help choose the exact display you want.

You can easily open and close toolbars on Synnax:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview/open-toolbars" />

You can close toolbars either by touching their respective icon or resizing it to the
edge:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview/close-toolbars" />

You can also have multiple visualizations displayed at the same time:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview/multiple-tabs" />

## Search and Command Palette

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

The Search and Command Palette at the top can be used to search for resources or to
activate commands. Searching for resources can be done by searching or pressing
<Icon.Keyboard.Control /> +`P` (Windows) / <Icon.Keyboard.Command /> +`P` (macOS). As an
example of searching for resources, you could search for a test range and then
automatically add it as the active range:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

The Search and Command Palette can run commands by entering a `>` into the toolbar or by
pressing <Icon.Keyboard.Control />+<Icon.Keyboard.Shift />+`P` (Windows) /
<Icon.Keyboard.Command />+<Icon.Keyboard.Shift /> +`P` (macOS). This allows you to run
commands such as toggling the color theme, creating a visualization, adding a range, or
opening the documentation:
