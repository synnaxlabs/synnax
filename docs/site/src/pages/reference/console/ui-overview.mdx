The Synnax Console provides a flexible environment to display and interact with data
stored and streamed through a Synnax cluster. It's interface is designed around two main
UI elements: the central layout mosaic and side toolbars.

The central mosaic displays visualizations such as line plots and schematics, while the
toolbars exists to provide access to resources, data ranges, tasks, and visualization
controls.

## Toolbars

To kick things off, we'll walk you through each of the toolbars and their functionality. 

### <Icon.Resources /> Resources 

The resource toolbar displays a file tree with folders for channels, ranges, users, and
workspaces.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Resource</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>[Channels](/reference/concepts/channels)</td>
      <td>All channels in the the Synnax cluster.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[Devices](/reference/device-drivers)</td>
      <td>The list of devices that are connected to the cluster.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[Ranges](/reference/console/ranges)</td>
      <td>Saved times that you can use when loading data to view.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[Tasks](/reference/device-drivers)</td>
      <tdThe current data acquisition and controls tasks running on devices connected to the cluster.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Users</td>
      <td>A list of all users registered in the cluster. The workspaces
      created by the users can be found underneath their name.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[Workspaces](/reference/console/workspaces)</td>
      <td>All created workspaces in the cluster. This tree includes
      workspaces created by all users.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

### <Icon.Range /> Ranges

The [range toolbar](/reference/console/ranges) allows you to create, view, and access
the ranges you're interested in visualizing.

resume the current tasks running on the cluster.

plots](/reference/console/line-plots) and [schematics](/reference/console/schematics).

## Mosaic

Synnax can be easily manipulated to help choose the exact display you want.

You can easily open and close toolbars on Synnax:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview/open-toolbars" />

You can close toolbars either by touching their respective icon or resizing it to the
edge:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview/close-toolbars" />

You can also have multiple visualizations displayed at the same time:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview/multiple-tabs" />

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Getting Help

The Synnax documentation website can be opened from within the console by clicking the
<Icon.QuestionMark/> icon.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Search and Command Palette

The search and command palette at the top can be used to search for resources or to
activate commands. Searching for resouces can be done by searching or pressing
<Icon.Keyboard.Control/>+`P` (Windows) / <Icon.Keyboard.Command />+`P` (MacOS). As an
example of searching for resources, you could search for a test range and then
automatically add it as the active range:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview/palette-search" />

<Icon.Keyboard.Return />

The search and command palette can run commands by entering a `>` into the toolbar or by
pressing <Icon.Keyboard.Control />+<Icon.Keyboard.Shift />+`P` (Windows) /
<Icon.Keyboard.Command />+<Icon.Keyboard.Shift />+`P` (MacOS). This allows you to run
commands such as toggling the color theme, creating a visualization, adding a range, or
opening the documentation:
