A Schematic, short for piping and instrumentation diagram, is used to see a diagram of
your physical or simulated system. It displays live sensor data and be used to
exercise manual control by changing the values of channels tied to actuators.
We've added a simple example of a Schematic below.

## Creating a Schematic

Creating a Schematic is as simple as adding a new tab and selecting the Schematic
visualization:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/schematic-create-schematic" />

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Modes

A Schematic has three modes: **view, edit, and control**. To change modes, use the
controls in the bottom-left hand corner of the Schematic.

In **edit mode**, symbols can be added, moved, and their properties can be
edited.

In **view mode**, live data from the system is displayed on the Schematic. Symbols are
not editable and the user cannot affect the system state.

In **control mode**, the user can click on symbols such as valves and buttons to
activate them.

## The Symbols Library

<Text.Text level="p">
A Schematic is assembled by dragging symbols out of the library and onto the screen.
These visual representation of sensors, actuators, and other components on your
hardware system. If the symbols are not appearing on the bottom of the screen,
make sure to click the visualization <Icon.Visualize/> icon in the bottom-right.

Synnax has a collection of built-in symbols including valves, live sensor
values, buttons, and tanks.

## Changing Symbol Properties

When selected, a symbol's properties will appear in the bottom toolbar. There
are several tabs that can be used to fine tune the look and behavior of the
symbol.

### The Style Tab

The style tab on allows users to edit the symbol's label, size, orientation,
color, and other visual properties.

### The Data Tab

The data tab is available on symbols that receive data. After selecting a
channel from the dropdown, the Schematic will fetch and display the live data from
that channel.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/schematic-configure-value" />

For the value symbol, the data tab has the following properties:

- **Input Channel** determines which channel to stream data from.
- **Precision** sets the number of decimal places to display.
- **Averaging Window** can be used to display a rolling average of the last N
  samples. For example, a value of 2 will cause the screen to display the
  average of the last 2 samples

### The Control Tab

The control tab is available on symbols that can be actuated. Controllable
symbols have two main properties:

- **Input Channel** represents the display state of the symbol. If the input
channel has a value of 1, the symbol will be display as solid (except for
normally open pneumatic valves).
- **Output Channel** will be written to when you click on the symbol. If the
symbol is de-activated, clicking on it will write 1 to the output channel (an
activation command). If the symbol is activated, clicking on it will write 0 to
the output channel (a deactivation command).

## Connection Lines

Every symbol has locations to attach connection lines. When hovering over an
symbol, these attachement points appear. To draw a connection line, click on an
attachement point and drag the line to a different symbol.

## Aligning Elements

To align elements, create a selection box by clicking and dragging on the
canvas. Then, use the vertical or horizontal alignment buttons to align the
selected elements.

## Changing Colors

You can also change the color of multiple symbols together in the same manner.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/schematic-change-color" />

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Control Mode

In control mode, elements on the Schematic are able to be activated for manual control
of the system. Clicking on an actionable element, such as a valve, switch, or
button, allows you to activate the output channel on that element. The circle on
the element shows what is in control. If the circle is blue, the current Schematic has
control. If the circle is green, the current Schematic has absolute control. If the
circle is red, the current Schematic does not have control as the element is part of
an automated sequence or controlled by another Schematic.

The color of the bar indicates what is controlling the elements on the Schematic.
There is a legend on the display indicating what controlling node is what color.
