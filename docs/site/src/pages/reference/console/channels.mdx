A [channel](/reference/concepts/channels) is a collection of time-ordered data in
Synnax. Channels are commonly used to store data from sources such as sensors, but can
also be used to store data as disparate as actuator commands, post-processed analysis
results, or any other time-ordered data. Normally, channels are directly written to by a
client, but [calculated channels](/reference/console/calculated-channels) can also be
used to generate data derived from other channels.

## Creating Channels

You can create a channel using the "Create Channel" command in the Command Palette. To
open the palette, click on the search bar at the top and type ">". You can also open the
palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).

### Channel Creation Parameters

When creating a channel, you will be prompted to fill in the following fields:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>A name for the channel.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Virtual</td>
      <td>
        If true, the channel will be
        [virtual](/reference/concepts/channels#virtual-channels), meaning no data will
        be permanently stored.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is Index</td>
      <td>
        If true, the channel will be an [index
        channel](/reference/concepts/channels#index-channels). Otherwise, the channel
        will be a [data channel](/reference/concepts/channels#data-channels).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Type</td>
      <td>
        What data type the channel stores. If the channel is an index channel, then the
        data type must be a timestamp.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Index</td>
      <td>
        For data channels, the index channel used to store timestamps for the data
        channels.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

### Index vs. Data Channels

Index channels are used to store timestamps for data channels. When creating a data
channel, it must be associated with an index channel. When a data channel records a data
point, that index channel will then store the timestamp for that data point. The
difference between the two types of channels is explained more in the [channel concepts
page](/reference/concepts/channels).

## Aliasing Channels

Channels can be [aliased](/reference/concepts/ranges#channel-aliases) under a particular
range. This is useful for naming a channel to something specific for that range. For
example, a channel might represent a port on a specific data acquisition computer and be
called "digital_input_1". However, for a certain test, the channel is used to store
pressure readings, so the name "pressure_01" is more appropriate. To alias a channel,
open the resources toolbar and right-click on the channel you want to alias.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/channels/alias" />

Now, the alias will be shown when the active range matches the one the channel is
aliased for, and the normal channel name will be shown otherwise.
