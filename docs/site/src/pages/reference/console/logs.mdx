Logs are used to view telemetry in a log format. They are useful for viewing low speed
sensor values, viewing and communicating control sequences states, and debugging
operations.

## Creating a Log

To create a log, add a new tab and select the log visualization:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/logs/log-create" />

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  Make sure that you are working in an active
  [workspace](/reference/console/workspaces)! If your log is not created in a workspace,
  it will not be saved permanently to Synnax.
</Note.Note>

## Choosing a Channel

To start viewing data, the only option you need to select is the channel to view data
from. You can do this by clicking on the channel selector in the Visualization Toolbar.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/logs/choose-channel" />

<Divider.Divider x />

## Pausing and Scrolling

To view historical data previously logged, simply scroll up. This will automatically
freeze the log window and allow you to scroll through the data. To resume live logging,
simply scroll back down to the bottom of the log window.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/logs/scrollback" />

### Using the Pause/Play Button

You can also pause and resume live logging by clicking the pause/play button the
top-right corner of the log window.
