A schematic is used to see a diagram of your physical or simulated system. It displays
live sensor data and can be used to exercise manual control by changing the values of
channels tied to actuators. We've added a simple example of a schematic below:

## Creating a Schematic

Creating a schematic is as simple as adding a new tab and selecting the schematic
visualization:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/schematics/create" />

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  Make sure that you are working in an active
  [workspace](/reference/console/workspaces)! If your schematic is not created in a
  workspace, it will not be saved permanently to Synnax.
</Note.Note>

## Modes

Schematics have three modes: **view**, **edit**, and **control**. To change modes, use
the controls in the top-right corner of the schematic.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Mode</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Edit</b>
      </td>
      <td>Symbols can be added and moved, and their properties can be edited.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>View</b>
      </td>
      {
        <td>
          Live data from the Core is displayed on the schematic. Symbols are not
          editable and the user cannot change the system state.
        </td>
      }
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Control</b>
      </td>
      <td>The user can click on symbols such as valves and buttons to control them.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

<Divider.Divider x />

## The Symbols Library

Schematics are assembled by dragging symbols out of the library and onto the screen.
These symbols are visual representation of sensors, actuators, and other components on
your hardware system. If the symbols are not appearing on the bottom of the screen, make
sure to click the visualization <Icon.Visualize /> icon in the bottom-left corner of the
Console.

Synnax has a collection of built-in symbols including valves, live sensor values,
buttons, and tanks.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Changing Symbol Properties

When selected, a symbol's properties will appear in the bottom Visualization Toolbar.
There are several tabs that can be used to fine-tune the look and behavior of the
symbol.

### Style Tab

The style tab on allows users to edit the symbol's label, size, orientation, color, and
other visual properties.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Property</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Label</b>
      </td>
      <td>The text that appears by the symbol.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Label Size</b>
      </td>
      <td>The size of the label.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Color</b>
      </td>
      <td>The color of the symbol.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Normally Open</b>
      </td>
      {
        <td>
          Causes the body of the solenoid valve to look different when it is open or
          closed.
        </td>
      }
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Width</b>
      </td>
      <td>Changes the size of a tank.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Height</b>
      </td>
      <td>Changes the size of a tank.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Scale</b>
      </td>
      <td>Changes the size of an element.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Units</b>
      </td>
      <td>Determines what units a value symbol is displaying.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Orientation</b>
      </td>
      {
        <td>
          Determines the orientation of the symbol and the relative placement of the
          label.
        </td>
      }
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

### Telemetry Tab

The telemetry tab is available on symbols that receive data, such as the value and light
symbols. After selecting a channel from the dropdown, the schematic will fetch and
display the live data from that channel.

The telemetry tab can have the following properties:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Property</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Input Channel</b>
      </td>
      <td>The channel to stream data from.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Precision</b>
      </td>
      <td>The number of decimal places to display.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Averaging Window</b>
      </td>
      {
        <td>
          Can be used to display a rolling average. For example, a value of 2 will cause
          the screen to display the average of the last 2 samples.
        </td>
      }
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

<Video client:only="react" id="console/schematics/value" />

### Control Tab

The control tab is available on symbols that can be actuated. Controllable symbols have
two main properties:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Property</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>State Channel</b>
      </td>
      {
        <td>
          Represents the display state of the symbol. If the input channel has a value
          of 1, the symbol will be display as activated.
        </td>
      }
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Command Channel</b>
      </td>
      {
        <td>
          Will be written to when you click on the symbol. If the symbol is
          de-activated, clicking on it will write 1 to the output channel (an activation
          command). If the symbol is activated, clicking on it will write 0 to the
          output channel (a deactivation command).
        </td>
      }
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Stylistic Modifying the Schematic

There are many ways that you can change the visuals of a schematic.

### Connection Lines

Every symbol has locations to attach connection lines. When hovering over an symbol,
these attachment points appear. To draw a connection line, click on an attachment point
and drag the line to a different symbol:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/schematics/connections" />

### Aligning Elements

To align elements, create a selection box by clicking and dragging on the canvas. Then,
use the vertical or horizontal alignment buttons to align the selected elements:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/schematics/align-items" />

### Changing Colors

You can also change the color of multiple symbols together in the same manner:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/schematics/change-color" />

<Divider.Divider x />

## Control Mode

In control mode, elements on the schematic are able to be activated for manual control
of the system. Clicking on an actionable element, such as a valve, switch, or button,
allows you to activate the output channel on that element. The circle on the element
shows what is in control. If the circle is blue, the current schematic has control. If
the circle is green, the current schematic has absolute control. If the circle is red,
the current schematic does not have control as the element is part of an automated
sequence or is controlled by another schematic.

The color of the bar indicates what writer is controlling the elements on the Schematic.
There is a legend on the display indicating what controlling writer is what color.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Snapshotting a Schematic

Oftentimes, you will want to save the configuration of a schematic to a particular
range, so you can see exactly how a schematic looked at a certain point in time. To do
this, you can snapshot a schematic to a range by finding the schematic in the Workspaces
Toolbar, opening the context menu, and snapshotting the schematic to a range.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/schematics/snapshot" />

<Divider.Divider x />

## Loading a Schematic from a JSON File

You can download a schematic as a JSON file so that it can be easily sent and loaded.

To download, right click on the schematics name in the Workspaces Toolbar and click
"Download as JSON":

<Video client:only="react" id="console/schematics/download" />

To import a schematic, you can drag and drop from your file system or right click on a
workspace name in the ontology menu:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/schematics/upload" />
