## Adding a New Cluster

Adding a new cluster is as simple as clicking the **Add Cluster** button in the top
right corner of the cluster toolbar and entering your connection parameters, as shown
below:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/connect" />

This will add a new cluster to the list and set it as active. The console continuously
monitors the connection to the cluster and displays it in the bottom right corner of the
UI.

## Cluster Toolbar

The cluster toolbar is located at the bottom right of the screen. From this toolbar, you
can add clusters, switch between them, and more.

If you have multiple clusters, you can switch between them by clicking on the cluster
you'd like to connect to in the toolbar:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/switch" />

Right-clicking on a cluster in the toolbar will open a context menu with options to
connect from, disconnect from, rename, and remove the cluster:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/context-menu" />

You can also copy a link to the cluster from the context menu. Opening this link will
open the Synnax Console with the cluster already connected.
