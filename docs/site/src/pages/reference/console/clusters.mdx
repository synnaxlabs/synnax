## Adding a New Core

Adding a new Core is as simple as clicking the **Connect** button in the top-right
corner of the Core toolbar and entering your connection parameters, as shown below:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/connect" />

This will add a new Core to the list and set it as active. The Console continuously
monitors the connection to the Core and displays it in the top-right corner of the UI.

## Cluster Toolbar

The cluster toolbar is located at the bottom right of the screen. From this toolbar, you
can add clusters, switch between them, and more.

If you have multiple clusters, you can switch between them by clicking on the cluster
you'd like to connect to in the toolbar:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/switch" />

Right-clicking on a cluster in the toolbar will open a context menu with options to
connect from, disconnect from, rename, and remove the cluster:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/context-menu" />

You can also copy a link to the cluster from the context menu. Opening this link will
open the Synnax Console with the cluster already connected.
