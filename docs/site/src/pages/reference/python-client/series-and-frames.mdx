Series and frames are the two fundamental structures used for working with channel data
in Synnax. This guide will walk you through how to use the `Series` and `Frame` classes
exposed by the Python client.

## Series

A series is a strongly typed array of data samples. It can contain any data you want it
to, but in the context of Synnax it almost always represents a set of contiguous samples
from a single channel.

### Constructing a Series

There are many ways to construct a series:

```python
import synnax as sy
import numpy as np

# Construct a series from a list of samples. In this case, the series
# will automatically be assumed to be of type int64.
series = sy.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# We can also manually specify the type of the series
series = sy.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], data_type=sy.DataType.INT32)

# Construct a series from a numpy array. The type of the series
# will be inferred from the numpy array.
series = sy.Series(np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=np.int64))

# Construct a series from a list of strings. In this case,
# the series will automatically be assumed to be of type string.
series = sy.Series(["apple", "banana", "cherry"])

# Construct a series from dictionaries. In this case, the series
# will automatically be assumed to be of type json.
series = sy.Series([{"a": 1}, {"b": 2}, {"c": 3}])
```

### Interop with Numpy

The `Series` class is designed to be directly compatible with numpy, and supports all of
the operations possible on a numpy array without needing to convert back and forth.
Here's a simple example:

```python
import synnax as sy
import numpy as np

series = sy.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# You can use numpy functions directly on a series
print(np.mean(series))
```

This means that it's also possible to pass a series directly into libraries like
`matplotlib`:

```python
import synnax as sy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x_data = sy.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y_data = sy.Series([1, 4, 9, 16, 25])

plt.plot(x_data, y_data)
plt.show()
```

If you'd like to convert a series to a numpy array, you can do so with the `to_numpy`
function or by simply passing the series to `np.array`:

```python
import synnax as sy

series = sy.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Convert the series to a numpy array
numpy_array = series.to_numpy()

# Convert the series to a numpy array using np.array
numpy_array = np.array(series)
```

### The Time Range Property

Whenever you read a series from Synnax, it will have a `time_range` property that
represents the time range occupied by the samples in the Series. This method can be
useful for getting a high-level understanding of when the samples were recorded without
needing to query an index channel.

The `start` field represents the timestamp for the first sample, and the `end` field
represents a timestamp just after the last sample (start-inclusive, end-exclusive).

It's also easy to define a time range when constructing your own series:

```python
import synnax as sy

start = sy.TimeStamp.now()

series = sy.Series(
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(
        start=start,
        end=start + sy.TimeSpan.SECOND * 6,
    )
)
```

## Frames

A frame is a collection of series from multiple channels. Frames are returned by methods
like:

- The `read` method on the client (`client.read`)
- The `read` method of a `Streamer` instance (`client.open_streamer`)
- The `value` property of an `Iterator` instance (`client.open_iterator`)

### Constructing a Frame

A frame maps the key or name of a channel to one or more series. Here are a few examples
of how to construct a frame:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Construct a frame for the given channel names.
frame = sy.Frame({
    "channel1": sy.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),
    "channel2": sy.Series([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]),
    "channel3": sy.Series([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]),
})

# Construct a frame from individual samples.
frame = sy.Frame({
    "channel1": 1,
    "channel2": 2,
    "channel3": 3,
})
```

### Accessing Frame Data

#### Using the dictionary interface

Frames can be accessed like dictionaries:

```python
import synnax as sy

data = frame["channel1"]
```

The `data` variable will be an instance of a `MultiSeries` object, which is a special
type of series that wraps multiple `Series` instances, but behaves pretty much exactly
like a single series:

```python
import synnax as sy

frame = sy.Frame({
    "channel1": [sy.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), sy.Series([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]
    "channel2": sy.Series([1, 2, 3]),
})

# Access the first series in the "channel1" key
data: sy.MultiSeries = frame["channel1"]
print(data[0]) # 1
print(data[-1]) # 10
```
