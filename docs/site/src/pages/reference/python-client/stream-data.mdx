Streaming data is useful for real-time processing, visualization, and
monitoring. This page guides you through using the Python client to stream data
from a Synnax cluster.

## Opening a Streamer

To start streaming data, call the `open_streamer` method on the client and
provide a list of channels to stream:

```python
streamer = client.open_streamer(["channel1", "channel2"])
```

## Reading Frames

To read the next incoming frame, call the `read` method on the streamer:

```python
frame = streamer.read()
```

This call will block until a new frame is available. **This frame may not
contain data for every channel specified**. For example, if we're reading from
two sensors that are being sampled by different devices at different rates, we
may receive a frame containing data only for the first channel, followed by a
frame containing only data for the second channel.

### Using a For Loop

The streamer object is an iterator, so you can use it in a for loop to iterate
over incoming frames, blocking on each iteration until a new frame is received:

```python
for frame in streamer:
    print(frame)
```

## Closing the Streamer

After you're done streaming, it's essential that you call the `close` method on
the streamer to release the network connection and other related resources:

```python
streamer.close()
```

### Using a Context Manager

We recommend using the streamer as a context manager where possible, as this
makes it easy to ensure that the streamer is closed correctly:

```python
with client.open_streamer(["channel1", "channel2"]) as streamer:
    for frame in streamer:
        print(frame)
```

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Using an Async Streamer

If you're interested in using `asyncio` to stream data, you can use the
`open_async_streamer` method on the client. This streamer implements an
identical interface to a synchronous streamer, but all methods are asynchronous:

```python
async with await client.open_async_streamer(["channel1", "channel2"]) as streamer:
    async for frame in streamer:
        print(frame)
```
