Streaming data is useful for real-time processing, visualization, and monitoring. This
page guides you through using the Python client to stream data from a Synnax cluster. If
you'd like a conceptual overview of how streaming works in Synnax, check out the
[streams](/reference/concepts/streams) page.

## Opening a Streamer

To start streaming data, call the `open_streamer` method on the client and provide a
list of channels to stream:

```python
streamer = client.open_streamer(["channel1", "channel2"])
```

<Divider.Divider x />

## Reading Frames

To read the next incoming frame, call the `read` method on the streamer:

```python
frame = streamer.read()
```

This call will block until a new frame is available.

### Specifying a Timeout

It's also possible to add a `timeout` parameter to the `read` method. If the timeout is
reached before a new frame is available, the method will return `None` instead of a
frame:

```python
frame = streamer.read(timeout=5) # Wait for 5 seconds
if frame is None:
    print("Timed out waiting for a frame")
```

You can also provide a `TimeSpan` object as the `timeout` parameter:

```python
import synnax as sy

frame = streamer.read(timeout=5 * sy.TimeSpan.SECOND)
if frame is None:
    print("Timed out waiting for a frame")
```

### Downsampling

If you are interested in streaming data at a lower rate, you can use the optional
`downsample_factor` parameter. This parameter will cause the streamer to skip the
specified number of samples in each series before returning the next frame. Note that
this parameter does not average values, and will skip samples instead.

For example, if you set the downsample factor to 2, every 2nd sample will be retained.

```python
stream = client.open_streamer(
# a streamer.read() will return [0.13, 0.14]
stream = client.open_streamer(
    channels=["temperature", "pressure"],
    downsample_factor=2
)
```

### Handling Partial Frames

When reading frames from a streamer, it's important to note that a frame may not contain
data for every channel specified when opening the streamer. For example, if we're
reading from two sensors, `temperature` and `pressure`, that are being sampled by
different devices at different rates, we may receive a frame containing data only for
the first channel, followed by a frame containing only data for the second channel.

```python
stream = client.open_streamer(["temperature", "pressure"])
frame = streamer.read()
print(frame[-1]) # Print only the last sample(s) in the frame
# Output: {"temperature": 25.0}
frame = streamer.read()
print(frame[-1])
# Output: {"pressure": 1013.25}
frame = streamer.read()
print(frame[-1])
# Output: {"temperature": 25.1, "pressure": 1013.25}
```

### Using a For Loop

The streamer object is an iterator, so you can use it in a for loop to iterate over
incoming frames, blocking on each iteration until a new frame is received:

```python
for frame in streamer:
    print(frame)
```

## Updating the Channel List

If you want to update the list of channels being streamed, you can call the
`update_channels` method on the streamer:

```python
streamer.update_channels(["channel3", "channel4"])
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  This method will *replace* the current list of channels with the new list, not add to
  it.
</Note.Note>

## Closing the Streamer

After you're done streaming, it's essential that you call the `close` method on the
streamer to release the network connection and other related resources:

```python
streamer.close()
```

### Using a Context Manager

We recommend using the streamer as a context manager where possible, as this makes it
easy to ensure that the streamer is closed correctly:

```python
with client.open_streamer(["channel1", "channel2"]) as streamer:
    for frame in streamer:
        print(frame)
```

## Using an Async Streamer

If you're interested in using `asyncio` to stream data, you can use the
`open_async_streamer` method on the client. This streamer implements an identical
interface to a synchronous streamer, but all methods are asynchronous:

```python
async with await client.open_async_streamer(["channel1", "channel2"]) as streamer:
    async for frame in streamer:
        print(frame)
```
