### Creating Multiple Channels

### Only Create a Channel if it Doesn't Exist

## Retrieving Channels

### Retrieving a Single Channel

### Retrieving Multiple Channels

### Retrieving a Channel Using a Range

If you've queried a [range](/reference/python-client/ranges), you can access channels as
properties. If the channel name is not a valid Python identifier, you can use the
dictionary accessor instead:

```python
# Retrieve the range
test_one = client.ranges.retrieve("02/22/23 Testing")

# Grab a channel like this
ch = test_one["sensor_one"]

# Or like this
ch = test_one.sensor_one
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  When using a range, it's possible to retrieve a channel by it's
  [alias](/reference/python-client/ranges#aliasing-channels) instead of its name.
