The Python client provides interfaces for creating, retrieving, and deleting channels.
We'll cover the details of each of these operations in this guide.

If you're unfamiliar with what channels are and how they work, check out the
[channels concepts guide](/reference/concepts/channels).

## Creating Channels

```python
# Create a time channel to store the timestamps of our data channel
time_index_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="time",
    # Index channels must have a data type of TIMESTAMP and is_index
    # set to True
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=True,
)

# You can also create a channel by creating the channel locally and
# passing it to the create method on the client.
my_sensor = sy.Channel(
    name="my_sensor",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=time_index_channel.key, # Pass the key of the index channel here.
)

# Create a data channel that stores 32-bit floats
data_channel = client.channels.create(my_sensor)
```

### Creating Multiple Channels

We can create multiple channels by passing a list to the `create` method. This is more
efficient than creating many channels individually, and provides the atomic guarantee
that either all or no channels will be created.

Keep in mind that we need to create index channels before we can create the data
channels that use them.

```python
import numpy as np

# We need to create the index first, that way we can provide the index key to our data
# channels.
time_index = client.channels.create(
    name="time",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=True,
)

sensor_one = sy.Channel(
    name="sensor_one",
    data_type=np.float32, # You can use numpy to define data types
    index=time_index.key,
)

sensor_two = sy.Channel(
    name="sensor_two",
    data_type="float32", # Or you can use strings
    index=time_index.key,
)

sensor_three = sy.Channel(
    name="sensor_three",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32, # Or you can use Synnax data types
    index=time_index.key,
)

data_channels = client.channels.create([
    sensor_one,
    sensor_two,
    sensor_three,
])
```

### Only Create a Channel if it Doesn't Exist

There are situations where we want to ensure that a channel with a particular name
exists, but don't want it duplicated if it has already been created. To accomplish this,
we can use the `retrieve_if_name_exists` flag:

```python
# Create a channel if it doesn't exist
data_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="my_channel",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=my_index.key,
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)
```

This also works when creating multiple channels:

```python
# Create multiple channels if they don't exist
data_channels = client.channels.create(
    [my_channel_one, my_channel_two, my_channel_three],
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)
```

## Retrieving Channels

We can retrieve channels using the `channels.retrieve` method.

### Retrieving a Single Channel

To retrieve a single channel, pass the channel's name or key to the `retrieve` method:

```python
# By name
my_sensor = client.channels.retrieve("my_sensor")

# If you know the key, you can also retrieve by key
my_sensor = client.channels.retrieve(my_sensor.key)
```

The client will raise a `NotFoundError` if no channels match the query, and a
`MultipleFoundError` if more than one channel matches the query. If you'd like to accept
no or multiple results, provide a list to the `retrieve` method as shown in the next
section.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Retrieving by key is faster than retrieving by name, and we recommend doing so when
  possible.
</Note.Note>

### Retrieving Multiple Channels

To retrieve multiple channels, pass a list of names or a list of keys to the `retrieve`
method:

```python
# By name
my_channels = client.channels.retrieve(["sensor_one", "sensor_two"])

# By key
my_channels = client.channels.retrieve([sensor_one.key, sensor_two.key])

# This won't work!
my_channels = client.channels.retrieve(["sensor_one", sensor_two.key])
```

Note that Synnax will not raise a `NotFoundError` if it cannot find a channel matching a
key or name. Instead, the missing channel will simply be omitted from the list of
results.

### Retrieving a Channel Using a Range

If you've queried a [range](/reference/python-client/ranges), you can access channels as
properties. If the channel name is not a valid Python identifier, you can use the
dictionary accessor instead:

```python
# Retrieve the range
test_one = client.ranges.retrieve("02/22/23 Testing")

# Grab a channel like this
ch = test_one["sensor_one"]

# Or like this
ch = test_one.sensor_one
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  When using a range, it's possible to retrieve a channel by it's
  [alias](/reference/python-client/ranges#aliasing-channels) instead of its name.
</Note.Note>

### Retrieving Channels Using Regular Expressions

If you're familiar with regular expressions, you can use them to retrieve channels that
match a pattern. For example, if we wanted to retrieve all channels that start with
"sensor", we could do the following:

```python
sensor_channels = client.channels.retrieve(["^sensor"])
```

It's important to note that if we're expecting multiple channels to match our pattern,
we need to pass in a list to the `retrieve` method, otherwise the client will raise a
`MultipleFoundError`.

## Renaming Channels

You can also rename channels from the Python client by calling the `channels.rename`
method. Currently, renaming must be done by key from the client or by calling the rename
method on an existing channel object.

```python
# Rename an already existing channel
data_channel.rename("new_name")

# Renaming from the client by key
client.channels.rename(data_channel.key, "new_name")

# Renaming multiple channels by key
client.channels.rename([channel_one.key, channel_two.key], ["name_one", "name_two"])
```

## Deleting Channels

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  Deleting a channel will also delete all of the data stored in that channel. This is a
  permanent operation that cannot be undone. Be careful!
</Note.Note>

To delete a channel, we can use the `channels.delete` method:

```python
# Delete channels matching a name
client.channels.delete("my_sensor")

# Delete channels matching a list of names
client.channels.delete(["sensor_one", "sensor_two"])

# Delete by key
client.channels.delete(sensor_three.key)

# Delete many by key
client.channels.delete([sensor_one.key, sensor_two.key, sensor_three.key])
```

Unlike with retrieving channels, Synnax will not raise an error if it cannot find a
channel matching the key or name. This means that `delete` is an idempotent operation,
and is safe to call even if the channel has already been deleted.

Deleting a channel by name will delete **all** channels with that name.
