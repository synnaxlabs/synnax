Synnax supports multiple methods for writing data to a Core. We can write directly to a
channel, fetch a range and set its data, or leverage writers for writing large volumes
of data.

Writes in Synnax are more complicated than reads, and, as such, we recommend checking
out our [concepts](/reference/concepts/writes) page to learn more about the best
practices for writing data to Synnax. The
[rules of writes](/reference/concepts/writes#rules-of-writes) are especially important.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Writing to a Channel

Writing to a channel requires us to write timestamps to its index channel before we
write the data. We'll create the following channels to use as examples:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Create the index
timestamps = client.channels.create(
    name="timestamps",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=True
)

# Create the temperature channel
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_tc",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=timestamps.key
)

# Create the pressure channel
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_pt",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=timestamps.key
)
```

We'll make sure to write timestamps to the index before we write to the data channel:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Our temperature data.
temperatures = [55, 55.1, 55.7, 57.2, 58.1]
start = sy.TimeStamp.now()
times = [
    start,
    start + 1 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
    start + 2 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
    start + 3 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
    start + 4 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
]

# Write the timestamps to the index
timestamps.write(start, times)

# Write the data to the channel
my_precise_tc.write(start, temperatures)
```

Notice how we align the two arrays using the common `start` timestamp. This tells Synnax
that the first sample in the `temperatures` array is associated with the first timestamp
in the `timestamps` array.

Synnax will raise a `ValidationError` if the index channel does not contain a
corresponding timestamp for every sample in the data channel. After all, it wouldn't
make sense to have a temperature reading without an associated timestamp.

## Writing to a Range

Writing to a range takes away the burden of needing to correctly align the data from
different channels.

We'll create the following range as an example:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Create the range
burst_test = client.ranges.create(
    name="burst_test",
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(
        start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
        end=sy.TimeStamp.now() + 1 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR
    )
)
```

Then, we'll write to the range using the `write` method:

```python
temperatures = [55, 55.1, 55.7, 57.2, 58.1, 58.9, 59.1, 59.2, 59.3]
pressures = [100, 100.1, 100.7, 102.2, 103.1, 103.9, 104.1, 104.2, 104.3]

# This call to write will assume that the timestamp of the first sample is
# the start of the range.
burst_test.write({
    "my_precise_tc": temperatures,
    "my_precise_pt": pressures,
})
```

## Using a Writer

While the above methods are great for writing static, existing data, it's common to
write data in a streaming fashion as it's acquired. This is especially useful for use in
control sequences and live data processing. The `Writer` class is designed for this use
case (and is actually used under the hood by the other methods).

To keep things intuitive, the writer maintains a file-like interface that is similar to
Python's built-in file objects. There are a few key differences, the most important
being that writers are governed by a transaction. If you'd like to learn more about
transactions and how writes work in Synnax, check out the
[concepts](/reference/concepts/writes) page.

We'll create the following channels to use as examples:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Create the index
timestamps = client.channels.create(
    name="timestamps",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=True
)

# Create the temperature channel
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_tc",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=timestamps
)
```

To open the writer, we use the `open_writer` method on the client and provide a starting
timestamp for the first sample and a list of channels we'd like to write to:

```python
import time

with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        })
        time.sleep(0.1)
    writer.commit()
```

This example will write 100 samples to the `my_precise_tc` channel, each spaced roughly
0.1 seconds apart, and will commit all writes when finished.

It's typical to write and commit millions of samples over the course of hours or days,
intermittently calling commit to ensure that the data is persisted to the Core.

We recommend using writers within a context manager. This ensures that a writer is
properly closed after use, ensuring that resources have been freed and sockets are
closed.

If you can't use a context manager, make sure you call `writer.close()` when you're done
using it.

### Auto-Commit

By default, writers are configured with auto-commit enabled, meaning each write is
immediately committed and available for read access. This is ideal for real-time data
acquisition where you want data to be immediately available for monitoring and analysis.

#### When to Disable Auto-Commit

You may want to disable auto-commit in the following scenarios:

- **Chunk-based file ingestion**: When loading historical data from files, you may want
  to commit data in logical chunks (e.g., after processing each file) to ensure atomic
  visibility of complete datasets.
- **Batch processing**: When ingesting large volumes of historical data where real-time
  visibility is not required and you want to optimize performance by reducing commit
  overhead.
- **Atomic transactions**: When you need multiple writes to appear together atomically
  to maintain data consistency across channels.

To disable auto-commit, set the `enable_auto_commit` argument to `False` when opening
the writer:

```python
import time

with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    enable_auto_commit=False,  # Disable auto-commit for manual control
) as writer:
    # Write data in chunks
    for chunk in range(10):
        for i in range(1000):
            writer.write({
                "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
                "my_precise_tc": i,
            })
        # Commit after each chunk of 1000 samples
        writer.commit()
```

### Write Authorities

Writers support dynamic control handoff. Multiple writers can be opened on a channel at
the same time, but only one writer is allowed to write to the channel. To determine
which writer has control, an authority from 0 to 255 is assigned to each writer (or,
optionally, each channel in the writer). The writer with the highest authority will be
allowed to write. If two writers have the same authority, the writer that opened first
will be allowed to write. For more information, see the
[concepts](/reference/concepts/writes#dynamic-control---write-authorities) page on
writers.

By default, writers are opened with an authority of `ABSOLUTE` i.e. 255. This means that
no other writers can write to the channel as long as the writer is open.

#### Opening a writer with the same authority on all channels

To open a writer with the same authority on all channels, you can pass the `authority`
argument with an integer.

```python
with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    authority=100,
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        })
        time.sleep(0.1)
```

#### Opening a writer with different authorities on each channel

To open a writer with different authorities on each channel, you can pass the
`authority` argument with a list of integers. This list must be the same length as the
number of channels in the writer.

```python
with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    authority=[100, 200],
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        })
        time.sleep(0.1)
```

#### Adjusting write authorities after open

To change the authority of a writer during operation, just call `set_authority`. This
method accepts a dictionary with the channel name as the key and the new authority as
the value.

```python
# Set the authority on all channels
writer.set_authority(200)
# Set the authority on just a few channels
writer.set_authority({
    "timestamps": 150,
    "my_precise_tc": 250,
})
```

### Persistence/Streaming Mode

By default, writers are opened in stream + persist
[mode](/reference/concepts/writes#persistencestreaming-modes). To change the mode of a
writer, specify the enum value of the `mode` argument when opening the writer. This can
be `persist`, `stream`, or `persist_stream`.

For example, to open a writer that only persists data:

```python
import synnax as sy

with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    mode="persist"
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        })
        time.sleep(0.1)
```

## Common Pitfalls

There are several common pitfalls to avoid when writing data to a Synnax Core. These are
important to avoid as they can lead to performance degradation and/or control issues.

### Using Many Individual Write Calls Instead of a Writer

When writing large volumes of data in a streaming fashion (or in batches), it's
important to use a writer instead of making individual write calls to a channel. Calls
to `write` on a channel use an entirely new transaction for each call - constantly
creating, committing, and closing transactions has a dramatic impact on performance. So,
don't do this:

```python
time = client.channels.retrieve("timestamps")
my_tc = client.channels.retrieve("my_precise_tc")
for i in range(100):
    # This is a very bad idea
    ts = sy.TimeStamp.now()
    time.write(ts, ts)
    my_tc.write(ts, i)
```

This is also a bad idea:

```python
# open and close a transaction for every write
for i in range(100):
    with client.open_writer(
        start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
        channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
        enable_auto_commit=True,
    ) as writer:
        writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        })
```

Instead, repeatedly call `write` on a single writer:

```python
# This is dramatically more efficient
with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    enable_auto_commit=True,
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        })
```

### Calling Commit on Every Write

If you've disabled auto-commit, it's important to call `commit` on the writer
periodically to ensure that the data is persisted to the cluster. However, calling
`commit` on every write is a bad idea. This is because `commit` requires a round-trip to
the cluster to ensure that the data is persisted. This can be very slow if you're
writing a lot of data. If you're writing a lot of data, commit every few seconds or use
auto-commit (which is enabled by default).

This is a bad idea:

```python
with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        })
        writer.commit()
```

Instead, use auto-commit (which is enabled by default):

```python
with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    # Auto-commit is enabled by default
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        })
```
