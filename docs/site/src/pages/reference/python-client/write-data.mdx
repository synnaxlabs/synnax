Synnax supports multiple methods for writing data to a cluster. We can write
directly to a channel, fetch a range and set its data, or leverage writers for
writing large volumes of data.

Writes in Synnax are more complicated than reads, and, as such, we recommend
checking out our [concepts](../concepts/write) page to learn more about
the best practices for writing data to Synnax.

## Writing to a Channel

Writing to a channel requires us to write timestamps to it's index channel
before we write the data. We'll create the following channels to use as
examples:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Create the index
timestamps = client.channels.create(
    name="timestamps",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=True
)

# Create the temperature channel
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_tc",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=timestamps.key
)

# Create the pressure channel
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_pt",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=timestamps.key
)
```

We'll make sure to write timestamps to the index before we write to the data
channel:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Our temperature data.
temperatures = [55, 55.1, 55.7, 57.2, 58.1]
start = sy.TimeStamp.now()
times = [
    start,
    start + 1 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
    start + 2 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
    start + 3 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
    start + 4 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
]

# Write the timestamps to the index
timestamps.write(start, times)

# Write the data to the channel
my_precise_tc.write(start, temperatures)
```

Notice how we align the two arrays using the common `start` timestamp. This
tells Synnax that the first sample in the `temperatures` array is associated
with the first timestamp in the `timestamps` array.

Synnax will raise a `ValidationError` if the index channel does not contain a
corresponding timestamp for every sample in the data channel. After all, it
wouldn't make sense to have a temperature reading without an associated
timestamp.

## Writing to a Range

Writing to a range takes away the burden of needing to correctly align the data
from different channels.

We'll create the following range as an example:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Create the range
burst_test = client.ranges.create(
    name="burst_test",
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(
        start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
        end=sy.TimeStamp.now() + 1 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR
    )
)
```

Then, we'll write to the range using the `write` method:

```python
temperatures = [55, 55.1, 55.7, 57.2, 58.1, 58.9, 59.1, 59.2, 59.3]
pressures = [100, 100.1, 100.7, 102.2, 103.1, 103.9, 104.1, 104.2, 104.3]

# This call to write will assume that the timestamp of the first sample is
# the start of the range.
burst_test.write({
    "my_precise_tc": temperatures,
    "my_precise_pt": pressures,
})
```

## Using a Writer

While the above methods are great for writing static, existing data, it's common
to write data in a streaming fashion for use in control sequences and live data
processing. The `Writer` class is designed for this use case (and is actually
used under the hood by the other methods).

Writers can be complicated to operate, so we recommend reading the
[concepts](../concepts/write#transactions) page to learn more about how
they work.

We'll use the following set of channels for this example:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Create the index
timestamps = client.channels.create(
    name="timestamps",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=True
)

# Create the temperature channel
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_tc",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=timestamps
)
```

To open the writer, we use the `open_writer` method on the client and provide a
starting timestamp for the first sample and a list of channels we'd like to
write to:

```python
import time

with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        })
        time.sleep(0.1)
    writer.commit()
```

This example will write 100 samples to the `my_precise_tc` channel, each spaced
roughly 0.1 seconds apart, and will commit all writes when finished.

It's typical to write and commit millions of samples over the course of hours or
days, intermittently calling commit to ensure that the data is persisted to the
cluster.

We recommend using writers within a context manager. This ensures that a writer
is properly closed after use, ensuring that resources have been freed and
sockets are closed.

If you can't use a context manager, make sure you call `writer.close()` when
you're done using it.

### Writer Auto-Commit

Alternatively, you could initiate a writer with auto-commit enabled by calling
`client.open_writer` with the additional configuration argument
`enable_auto_commit=True`. When auto-commit is enabled, a writer will commit
after each write, automatically saving the data to the database. The writer must
still be closed by calling `writer.close()`.
