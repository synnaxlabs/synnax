Synnax supports multiple methods for writing data to a cluster. We can write directly to
a channel, fetch a range and set its data, or leverage writers for writing large volumes
of data.

Writes in Synnax are more complicated than reads, and, as such, we recommend checking
out our [concepts](/reference/concepts/writes) page to learn more about the best
practices for writing data to Synnax. The [rules of
writes](/reference/concepts/writes#rules-of-writes) are especially important.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Writing to a Channel

Writing to a channel requires us to write timestamps to its index channel
before we write the data. We'll create the following channels to use as
examples:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Create the index
timestamps = client.channels.create(
    name="timestamps",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=True
)

# Create the temperature channel
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_tc",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=timestamps.key
)

# Create the pressure channel
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_pt",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=timestamps.key
)
```

We'll make sure to write timestamps to the index before we write to the data
channel:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Our temperature data.
temperatures = [55, 55.1, 55.7, 57.2, 58.1]
start = sy.TimeStamp.now()
times = [
    start,
    start + 1 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
    start + 2 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
    start + 3 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
    start + 4 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR,
]

# Write the timestamps to the index
timestamps.write(start, times)

# Write the data to the channel
my_precise_tc.write(start, temperatures)
```

Notice how we align the two arrays using the common `start` timestamp. This
tells Synnax that the first sample in the `temperatures` array is associated
with the first timestamp in the `timestamps` array.

Synnax will raise a `ValidationError` if the index channel does not contain a
corresponding timestamp for every sample in the data channel. After all, it
wouldn't make sense to have a temperature reading without an associated
timestamp.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Writing to a Range

Writing to a range takes away the burden of needing to correctly align the data
from different channels.

We'll create the following range as an example:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Create the range
burst_test = client.ranges.create(
    name="burst_test",
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(
        start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
        end=sy.TimeStamp.now() + 1 * sy.TimeSpan.HOUR
    )
)
```

Then, we'll write to the range using the `write` method:

```python
temperatures = [55, 55.1, 55.7, 57.2, 58.1, 58.9, 59.1, 59.2, 59.3]
pressures = [100, 100.1, 100.7, 102.2, 103.1, 103.9, 104.1, 104.2, 104.3]

# This call to write will assume that the timestamp of the first sample is
# the start of the range.
burst_test.write({
    "my_precise_tc": temperatures,
    "my_precise_pt": pressures,
})
```

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Using a Writer

While the above methods are great for writing static, existing data, it's common
to write data in a streaming fashion as it's acquired. This is especially useful
for use in control sequences and live data processing. The `Writer` class is designed
for this use case (and is actually used under the hood by the other methods).

To keep things intuitive, the writer maintains a file-like interface that is similar
to Python's built-in file objects. There are a few key differences, the most
important being that writers are governed by a transaction. If you'd like to
learn more about transactions and how writes work in Synnax, check out the
[concepts](/reference/concepts/writes) page.

We'll create the following channels to use as examples:

```python
import synnax as sy

# Create the index
timestamps = client.channels.create(
    name="timestamps",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=True
)

# Create the temperature channel
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my_precise_tc",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=timestamps
)
```

To open the writer, we use the `open_writer` method on the client and provide a
starting timestamp for the first sample and a list of channels we'd like to
write to:

```python
import time

with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        if not writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        }):
            print("Failed to write")
            break
        time.sleep(0.1)
    writer.commit()
```

This example will write 100 samples to the `my_precise_tc` channel, each spaced
roughly 0.1 seconds apart, and will commit all writes when finished.

It's typical to write and commit millions of samples over the course of hours or
days, intermittently calling commit to ensure that the data is persisted to the
cluster.

We recommend using writers within a context manager. This ensures that a writer
is properly closed after use, ensuring that resources have been freed and
sockets are closed.

If you can't use a context manager, make sure you call `writer.close()` when
you're done using it.

### Auto-Commit

You can also configure a writer to automatically commit written data after each
write, making it immediately available for read access. To do this, set the
`enable_auto_commit` argument to `True` when opening the writer:

```python
import time

with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    enable_auto_commit=True,
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        if not writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        }):
            print("Failed to write")
            break
        time.sleep(0.1)
```

### Error Handling

The Synnax writer is tuned for performance, and as such, does not synchronously check
for errors on every single call to write. Instead, calls to `write` will return a
boolean indicating whether the writer has accumulated any errors on the call to write
or on any previous calls to write.

Once a writer has accumulated an error, all future calls to `write` will fail until the
writer is closed and a new writer is opened. After calls to `write` return `False`, you
can check for the accumulated error by calling `writer.error()` or simply close the
writer through `writer.close()`, at which point the error will be raised.

#### Error Handling Example - Out of Order Timestamps

Let's say we're writing a time series to a channel, but we accidentally write the timestamps
out of order. This is a common mistake, and can be hard to debug. Here's how we can use
the writer to handle this:

```python
import synnax as sy

time_ch = client.channels.create(
    name="time",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=True,
)

data_ch = client.channels.create(
    name="data",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=time_ch.key,
)

with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=[time_ch.key, data_ch.key],
    enable_auto_commit=True,
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        if not writer.write({
            time_ch.key: sy.TimeStamp.now() - i * sy.TimeSpan.SECOND,
            data_ch.key: [i],
        }):
            break
```

This will break out of the loop as soon as the writer encounters an out of order
timestamp, causing the context manager to complete, the writer to be closed, and
a `ValidationError` to be raised.

### Write Authorities

Writers support dynamic control handoff. Multiple writers can be opened on a channel at
the same time, but only one writer is allowed to write to the channel. To determine
which writer has control, an authority from 0 to 255 is assigned to each writer (or,
optionally, each channel in the writer). The writer with the highest authority will be
allowed to write. If two writers have the same authority, the writer that opened first
will be allowed to write. For more information, see the
[concepts](/reference/concepts/writes#dynamic-control---write-authorities) page on
writers.

By default, writers are opened with an authority of `ABSOLUTE` i.e. 255. This means that
no other writers can write to the channel as long as the writer is open.

#### Opening a writer with the same authority on all channels

To open a writer with the same authority on all channels, you can pass the `authority`
argument with an integer.

```python
with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    authority=100,
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        if not writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        }):
            print("Failed to write")
            break
        time.sleep(0.1)
```

#### Opening a writer with different authorities on each channel

To open a writer with different authorities on each channel, you can pass the `authority`
argument with a list of integers. This list must be the same length as the number of channels
in the writer.

```python
with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    authority=[100, 200],
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        if not writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        }):
            print("Failed to write")
            break
        time.sleep(0.1)
```

#### Adjusting write authorities after open

To change the authority of a writer during operation, just call `set_authority`. This method
accepts a dictionary with the channel name as the key and the new authority as the value.

```python
# Set the authority on all channels
writer.set_authority(200)
# Set the authority on just a few channels
writer.set_authority({
    "timestamps": 150,
    "my_precise_tc": 250,
})
```

### Persistence/Streaming Mode

By default, writers are opened in stream + persist [mode](/reference/concepts/writes#persistencestreaming-modes).
To change the mode of a writer, specify the enum value of the `mode` argument when
opening the writer. This can be `persist`, `stream`, or `persist_stream`.

For example, to open a writer that only persists data:

```python
import synnax as sy

with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    mode="persist"
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        if not writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        }):
            print("Failed to write")
            break
        time.sleep(0.1)
```

## Common Pitfalls

There are several common pitfalls to avoid when writing data to a Synnax cluster. These
are important to avoid as they can lead to performance degradation and/or control issues.

### Using Many Individual Write Calls Instead of a Writer

When writing large volumes of data in a streaming fashion (or in batches), it's important
to use a writer instead of making individual write calls to a channel. Calls to `write`
on a channel use an entirely new transaction for each call - constantly creating, committing,
and closing transactions has a dramatic impact on performance. So, don't do this:

```python
time = client.channels.retrieve("timestamps")
my_tc = client.channels.retrieve("my_precise_tc")
for i in range(100):
    # This is a very bad idea
    ts = sy.TimeStamp.now()
    time.write(ts, ts)
    my_tc.write(ts, i)
```

This is also a bad idea:

```python
# open and close a transaction for every write
for i in range(100):
    with client.open_writer(
        start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
        channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
        enable_auto_commit=True,
    ) as writer:
        if not writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        }):
            print("Failed to write")
            break
```

Instead, repeatedly call `write` on a single writer:

```python
# This is dramatically more efficient
with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    enable_auto_commit=True,
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        if not writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        }):
            print("Failed to write")
            break
```

### Calling Commit on Every Write

If you're not using auto-commit, it's important to call `commit` on the writer
periodically to ensure that the data is persisted to the cluster. However, calling
`commit` on every write is a bad idea. This is because `commit` requires a round-trip
to the cluster to ensure that the data is persisted. This can be very slow if you're
writing a lot of data. If you're writing a lot of data, commit every few seconds or
turn on auto-commit.

This is a bad idea:

```python
with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        if not writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        }):
            print("Failed to write")
            break
        writer.commit()
```

Instead, use auto-commit:

```python
with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    enable_auto_commit=True,
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        if not writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        }):
            print("Failed to write")
            break
```

### Not Handling Errors by Checking the Return Value of `write`

It's important to check the return value of `write` to ensure that the write was
successful. Failing to check this return value can result in the writer silently
failing to write data, causing hard to debug issues.

This is a bad idea:

```python
with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    enable_auto_commit=True,
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        })
```

Instead, check the return value of `write`:

```python
with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["timestamps", "my_precise_tc"],
    enable_auto_commit=True,
) as writer:
    for i in range(100):
        if not writer.write({
            "timestamps": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "my_precise_tc": i,
        }):
            print("Failed to write")
            break
```
