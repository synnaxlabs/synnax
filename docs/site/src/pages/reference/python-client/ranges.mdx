Ranges identify specific periods of time with a name. We can use the Python client to
read from, write to, and attach metadata to these ranges.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Creating Ranges

To create a range, we can use the `client.ranges.create` method:

```python
import synnax as sy
from datetime import datetime

time_format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

my_range = client.ranges.create(
    # This name does not need to be unique, but it's a good idea to
    # pick something that will be easy to identify later.
    name="My Range",
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(
        start = datetime.strptime("2023-2-12 12:30:00", time_format),
        end = datetime.strptime("2023-2-12 14:30:00", time_format),
    ),
)
```

Synnax will automatically generate a unique identifier for the range.

### Only Create a Range if it Doesn't Exist

If we only want to create a range if one with the same name doesn't already exist, we
can pass in the `retrieve_if_name_exists` parameter:

```python
my_range = client.ranges.create(
    name="My Range",
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(
        start = datetime.strptime("2023-2-12 12:30:00", time_format),
        end = datetime.strptime("2023-2-12 14:30:00", time_format),
    ),
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)
```

In the event the range already exists, Synnax will return the existing range instead of
creating a new one.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Retrieving Ranges

We can fetch a range using the `client.ranges.retrieve` method.

### Retrieving a Single Range

We can retrieve a range by its name or key:

```python
# By name
my_range = client.ranges.retrieve(name="My Range")

# By key
my_range = client.ranges.retrieve(key=my_range.key)
```

Synnax will raise a `NotFoundError` if the range does not exist, and a
`MultipleFoundError` if multiple ranges with the given name exist. If you'd like to
accept multiple or no results, provide a list to the `retrieve` method as shown below.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  The `retrieve` method only supports passing in named parameters i.e. `name`, `key`,
  `names`, `keys`. If you try to pass in unnamed parameters, Synnax will raise a
  `TypeError`.
</Note.Note>

### Retrieving Multiple Ranges

We can retrieve multiple ranges by passing a list of names or keys to the `retrieve`
method:

```python
# By name
my_ranges = client.ranges.retrieve(names=["My Range", "My Other Range"])

# By key
my_ranges = client.ranges.retrieve(keys=[my_range.key, my_other_range.key])

# This won't work!
my_ranges = client.ranges.retrieve(names=["My Range", my_other_range.key])
```

In these examples, Synnax will not raise an error if a range cannot be found. Instead,
the missing range will be omitted from the returned list.

## Working with Channels

### Accessing Channels

We can access the channels on a range as if they were class properties or dictionary
keys:

```python
my_range = client.ranges.retrieve(name="My Range")

# Using a property accessor
my_pressure_channel = my_range.pressure_2
# Using a dictionary accessor
my_pressure_channel = my_range["pressure_2"]
```

### Accessing Multiple Channels

We can also access multiple channels on the range by passing a regular expression to our
property accessor:

```python
my_range = client.ranges.retrieve(name="My Range")

# Returns an iterable object containing matching channels
my_pressure_channels = my_range["^pressure"]
```

If we try to access channel-specific methods on the returned object, such as a `name` or
`data`, Synnax will raise `MultipleFoundError`. Instead, we should iterate over the
returned list. Here's a simple example where we plot the data from all of our pressure
channels:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

for ch in my_range["^pressure"]:
    plt.plot(my_range.timestamps, ch, label=ch.name)
```

This iteration pattern is valid even if we only have one channel that matches our
regular expression.

### Aliasing Channels

Channels must maintain their original names, but situations arise where we'd like to
give a channel a more descriptive name in the context of a particular range. Ranges
allow us to do just that.

Imagine we have a channel named `daq_analog_input_1` that we'd like to refer to as
`tank_pressure` for a tank burst test. We can do this by aliasing the channel:

```python
burst_test = client.ranges.retrieve(name="Oct 10 Burst Test")

# Set our alias
burst_test.daq_analog_input_1.set_alias("tank_pressure")

# We can also set an alias like this
burst_test.set_alias("daq_analog_input_1", "tank_pressure")
```

We can now access the channel using its alias:

```python
burst_test.tank_pressure
```

Subsequent calls to `set_alias` will overwrite the previous alias.

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  Aliases are only valid within the context of a particular range. If you try to access
  an aliased channel outside of the range, Synnax will not be able to find it.
</Note.Note>

## Attaching Metadata

### Setting Metadata

It's common to have non-data information we'd like to attach to a particular range, such
as test configuration parameters, numeric results, part numbers, etc. We can attach this
metadata to a range using the `meta_data` property:

```python
burst_test = client.ranges.retrieve(name="Oct 10 Burst Test")

# Set a single key/value pair
burst_test.meta_data.set("part_number", "12345")

# Another way to set a single key/value pair
burst_test.meta_data["part_number"] = "12345"

# Set multiple key/value pairs
burst_test.meta_data.set({
    "part_number": "12345",
    "test_configuration": "Test 1",
    "test_result": "123.45",
})
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  All metadata values are stored as strings. It's up to you to correctly cast the values
  to the appropriate type.
</Note.Note>

### Getting Metadata

Getting metadata is as easy as setting it:

```python
burst_test = client.ranges.retrieve(name="Oct 10 Burst Test")

# Retrieve a single key
part_number = burst_test.meta_data.get("part_number")

# Another way to retrieve a single key
part_number = burst_test.meta_data["part_number"]
```

### Deleting Metadata

We can delete metadata using the `delete` method:

```python
burst_test = client.ranges.retrieve(name="Oct 10 Burst Test")

# Delete a single key
burst_test.meta_data.delete("part_number")

# Another way to delete a single key
del burst_test.meta_data["part_number"]

# Delete multiple keys
burst_test.meta_data.delete(["part_number", "test_configuration"])
```

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Deleting Ranges

Deleting a range is as simple as passing in its name or key to the `delete` method:

```python
client.ranges.delete(name="My Range")
client.ranges.delete(key=my_range.key)
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Deleting a range by name will delete _all_ ranges with that name. Be careful!
</Note.Note>

We can delete multiple ranges by passing a list of names or keys to the `delete` method:

```python
client.ranges.delete(names=["My Range", "My Other Range"])
client.ranges.delete(keys=[my_range.key, my_other_range.key])
```
