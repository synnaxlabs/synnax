Synnax provides first-class support for Python. Our client delivers many capabilities,
including

- Direct integration with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and
  [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html).
- Tooling to implement automated control of your hardware.
- Change data capture (CDC) infrastructure to build automated analysis pipelines.

In this section, we'll cover how to install the client and authenticate with a Core.

## Authenticating with a Core

There are two ways to authenticate with a Synnax Core: using the CLI to permanently
store your credentials, or passing your credentials directly to the client.

### The Synnax Login Command

The easiest way to authenticate with a Core is with the `login` command. This will
permanently store your credentials in the operating system's keychain, and allow you to
use the client without passing credentials directly.

We highly recommend this method when using Synnax for data analysis, as it makes it easy
to use the client in a Jupyter notebook and share scripts without accidentally revealing
your credentials.

To authenticate, run the following command:

```bash
sy login
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  If you get the error `command not found`, you might not have Python scripts in your
  `PATH` variable. See our [troubleshooting
  guide](/reference/python-client/troubleshooting) for more information.
</Note.Note>

This command will prompt us for the following information:

```
Enter your Synnax connection parameters:
Host (localhost): # YOUR HOST
Port (9090): # YOUR PORT
Username (synnax): # YOUR USERNAME
Password: # YOUR PASSWORD
Secure connection? (y/n) (n):
```

For the last question, enter `y` if your Core is running in secure mode, and `n`
otherwise. If all goes well, you should see the following message:

```
Saved credentials. You can now use the Synnax Client
without having to log in. To connect to the Core in a Python shell, use the following:

from synnax import Synnax
client = Synnax()
```

Now that you've authenticated, you can instantiate the client as follows:

```python
import synnax as sy

client = sy.Synnax()
```

### Passing Credentials Directly
