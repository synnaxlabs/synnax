Synnax provides first-class support for Python. Our client delivers many capabilities,
including

- Direct integration with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and
  [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html).
- Tooling to implement automated control of your hardware.
- Change data capture (CDC) infrastructure to build automated analysis pipelines.

In this section, we'll cover how to install the client and authenticate with a cluster.

## Installation

The `synnax` library requires Python 3.11 or higher, and is available on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/synnax/). Install it directly using `pip` or define it
as a requirement in your virtual environment of choice:

```bash
pip install synnax
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Python can be difficult to get installed and running correctly, so we've put together
  a [troubleshooting guide](/reference/python-client/troubleshooting) that you can
  reference.

## Authenticating with a Cluster

There are two ways to authenticate with a Synnax cluster: using the CLI to permanently
store your credentials, or passing your credentials directly to the client.

### The Synnax Login Command

The easiest way to authenticate with a Synnax cluster is with the `login` command. This
will permanently store your credentials in the operating system's keychain, and allow
you to use the client without passing credentials directly.

We highly recommend this method when using Synnax for data analysis, as it makes it easy
to use the client in a Jupyter notebook and share scripts without accidentally revealing
your credentials.

To authenticate, run the following command:

```bash
sy login
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  If you get the error `command not found`, you might not have Python scripts in your
  `PATH` variable. See our [troubleshooting
  guide](/reference/python-client/troubleshooting) for more information.
</Note.Note>

This command will prompt us for the following information:

```
Enter your Synnax connection parameters:
Host (localhost): # YOUR HOST
Port (9090): # YOUR PORT
Username (synnax): # YOUR USERNAME
Password: # YOUR PASSWORD
Secure connection? (y/n) (n):
```

For the last question, enter `y` if your cluster is running in secure mode, and `n`
otherwise. If all goes well, you should see the following message:

```
Saved credentials. You can now use the Synnax Client
without having to log in. To connect the cluster in a Python shell, use the following:

from synnax import Synnax
client = Synnax()
```

Now that you've authenticated, you can instantiate the client as follows:

```python
import synnax as sy

client = sy.Synnax()
```

### Passing Credentials Directly

Passing authentication parameters directly is ideal in scenarios where you'd like to use
configuration files or environment variables to store your credentials. We recommend
this approach when connecting to Synnax in custom applications or automated analysis
servers.

To authenticate directly, simply pass your connection parameters to the `Synnax`
constructor:

```python
import synnax as sy

client = sy.Synnax(
    host="demo.synnaxlabs.com",
    port=9090,
    username="synnax",
    password="seldon",
    secure=True
)
```

Here's an example with environment variables:

```python
import os
import synnax as sy

client = sy.Synnax(
    host=os.environ["SYNNAX_HOST"],
    port=int(os.environ["SYNNAX_PORT"]),
    username=os.environ["SYNNAX_USERNAME"],
    password=os.environ["SYNNAX_PASSWORD"],
    secure=bool(os.environ["SYNNAX_SECURE"])
)
```
