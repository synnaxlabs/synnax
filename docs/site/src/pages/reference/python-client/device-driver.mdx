While our [pre-built drivers](/reference/device-drivers) are great for the devices we
support, you may need (or want) to integrate your own devices with Synnax. This guide
will walk you through the process of building a reliable, performant driver using the
Synnax Python client. We'll use an Arduino as an example device, but the process is very
similar for other devices.

### Outline

We'll split this guide into four sections:

1. [Setup and Installation](#setup-and-installation)
2. [Making a Read-Only Driver](#read-only-driver)
3. [Making a Write-Only Driver](#write-only-driver)
4. [Making a Read-Write Driver](#read-write-driver)

<Divider.Divider x />

## <StepText step={1} level="h2">Setup and Installation</StepText>

We'll kick things off by downloading the Arduino IDE, starting a Synnax cluster, and
installing the relevant Python packages to communicate with both the Arduino and Synnax.

### <StepText step="1.1" level="h3">Downloading the Arduino IDE</StepText>

The best way to get started with the Arduino is to download and run the
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

We'll be using an
[Arduino Mega 2560](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mega-2560-rev3) for this
guide, but any Arduino board will work.

After you open the Arduino IDE, you'll see a splash screen like this:

<Image
  client:only="react"
  id="guides/software/arduino-splashscreen"
  themed={false}
  style={{ maxWidth: 500 }}
/>

This is where we'll add our Arduino code to communicate with Python, and, ultimately,
Synnax.

### <StepText step="1.2" level="h3">Installing Synnax</StepText>

There are two components we need to install to get started with Synnax: the
[cluster](/reference/cluster/quick-start) and the
[console](/reference/console/get-started). The cluster is the central Synnax database
that streams and permanently stores all of the data we collect from the Arduino. The
console is a graphical interface for interacting with the cluster. It can be used to
both visualize incoming data and send commands to the Arduino.

#### <StepText step="1.2.1" level="h4">The Cluster</StepText>

The easiest way to install the cluster is using
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started). To run the latest version, you can use the
following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name synnax -p 9090:9090 synnaxlabs/synnax:latest -i
```

The `-d` flag tells Docker to run the container in the background. The `-p 9090:9090`
tells Docker to map port 9090 of the container to port 9090 on the host machine, and the
`-i` flag tells the container to run without encryption enabled. If you don't completely
understand what this means, that's totally ok.

To check that the container is running, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```

This should return something like the following:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                      COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
6f9dc7d9b2ad   synnaxlabs/synnax:latest   "/synnax/synnax starâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:9090->9090/tcp   synnax
```

#### <StepText step="1.2.2" level="h4"> The Console</StepText>

Now that we have the cluster running, it's time to download and run the
[Synnax Console](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/console/get-started).

Once you've downloaded the console, you can run it by finding the "Synnax" app in your
start menu or launch pad. After it boots up, you'll see a screen like this:

<Image id="console/get-started/window" client:only="react" />

The next step is to connect the console to the cluster we just started. To do this,
navigate to the clusters dropdown in the bottom left corner of the console, and click on
the pre-populated "Local" option. You'll see the chip on the bottom right corner switch
to "connected" once the console has successfully connected to the cluster.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/clusters/switch" />

### <StepText step="1.2.3" level="h4">Installing the Python Packages</StepText>

There are two Python packages we need to install to get started with our custom driver:
the Synnax Python client, and the `pyserial` package.

To install the Synnax Python client, run:

```bash
pip install synnax
```

To install the `pyserial` package, run:

```bash
pip install pyserial
```

We're going to be installing these packages without a virtual environment, although you
are free to use one if you'd like. We'll also be working in a file called `driver.py`
that we'll put in a `arduino-synnax` folder within our `Desktop` directory. This
location is arbitrary, so you're free to put it wherever you'd like.

<Divider.Divider x />

## <StepText step={2} level="h2">Read-Only Driver</StepText>

Now that the setup is out of the way, it's time to get started on the read-only driver.
We'll set up the Arduino to continuously read from an analog input and send the value
over serial. Our Python script will capture each incoming value and write it to a
[channel](/reference/concepts/channels) in Synnax. This may sound complicated, but it's
actually going to total around 50 lines of code.

### <StepText step="2.1" level="h3">Arduino Code</StepText>

The first thing we need to do is get the Arduino prepped and ready to communicate over
serial with our Python driver. Here's the code we'll write in the Arduino IDE:

```cpp
// Analog pin to read the value
const int analogPin = A0;

void setup() {
// Set the baud rate to 9600 bps
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Read from the analog pin
  float analogValue = analogRead(analogPin);
  // Write to the serial bus
  Serial.println(analogValue);
  // Delay by 100ms, which means we'll roughly take measurements at 10Hz
  delay(100);
}
```

This code will continuously read from the analog pin at 10Hz and send the value over
serial. To start running the code, you can upload it to the Arduino by hitting the
"upload" button in the top right corner of the Arduino IDE.

### <StepText step="2.2" level="h3">Setting up the Serial Connection in Python</StepText>

In our `driver.py` script, we'll import the `serial` package and set up the serial
connection to the Arduino. To do this, we'll need to know the port we're using to
connect to the Arduino. You can find that in the top right corner of the Arduino IDE
when the Arduino is connected to your computer over USB. We'll also need the baud rate,
which we set to 9600 in the Arduino code.

```python
import serial

PORT = "/dev/ttyACM0"
BAUD_RATE = 9600

ser = serial.Serial(PORT, BAUD_RATE)
if ser.is_open:
    print("Serial connection established")
else:
    print("Failed to establish serial connection")
```

To verify that everything works, we'll run the script and see if the output indicates
that the serial connection was established successfully.

```shell
python driver.py
# Output
Serial connection established
```

### <StepText step="2.3" level="h3">Reading from the Arduino</StepText>

To read from the Arduino, we'll use the `ser.readline()` method, which will read a line
from the serial port and return it as a string. We'll then convert the string to a float
and store it in the `value` variable.

```python
value = float(ser.readline().decode("utf-8").rstrip())
```

To repeat this process continuously, we'll modify our existing script to run in a loop.

```python
import serial

PORT = "/dev/ttyACM0"
BAUD_RATE = 9600

ser = serial.Serial(PORT, BAUD_RATE)

while True:
    value = float(ser.readline().decode("utf-8").rstrip())
    print(value)
```

This loop will continuously read from the Arduino and print the value to the console.
That's all we need to do for the Arduino, now it's time to integrate it with Synnax.

### <StepText step="2.4" level="h3">Setting up the Synnax Client</StepText>

The next step to tackle is setting up the Synnax client to communicate with the cluster.
First, we'll add an import for the `synnax` package at the top of our file:

```python
import synnax as sy
import serial

# ... rest of driver.py
```

Then, we'll create a `Client` instance to interact with the Synnax cluster.

```python
# ..imports

client = sy.Synnax(
    host="localhost",
    port=9090,
    username="synnax",
    password="seldon",
)

# ... rest of driver.py
```

Next, we need to create **two** channels in Synnax. Why two? For storing data, Synnax
requires us to create an _index_ channel. An index channel stores timestamps for the
samples that we collect, and is used so that synnax can look up the samples in our data
channels at a later time.

The second channel, a _data_ channel, is used to store the samples themselves. This data
channel will be _indexed_ by the timestamps stored in the first channel. We'll name the
channels `arduino_time` and `arduino_value`.

```python
# ... imports

client = sy.Synnax(
    # ... connection parameters
)

index_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="arduino_time",
    # Set is_index to True to create an index channel
    is_index=True,
    # Tell Synnax that we'll be storing timestamps in this channel
    data_type="timestamp",
    # If a channel with this name already exists, Synnax will return it instead of
    # creating a new one. This is useful if we restart the driver and want to keep the
    # existing channels.
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)

data_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="arduino_value",
    # Set the index to the key of the index channel, so that "arduino_value" is indexed
    # by "arduino_time"
    index=index_channel.key,
    # Tell Synnax that we'll be storing float32s in this channel
    data_type="float32",
    # If a channel with this name already exists, Synnax will return it instead of
    # creating a new one. This is useful if we restart the driver and want to keep the
    # existing channels.
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)

# ... rest of driver.py
```

### <StepText step="2.5" level="h3">Modifying the Loop to Write to Synnax</StepText>

Now that we have our Synnax client and the relevant channels created, it's time to
adjust our current loop to write to Synnax. The first thing we'll do is open a new
writer to the `arduino_time` and `arduino_value` channels. Writers are the primary
method for writing data to Synnax, and are created by calling the `open_writer` method
on the client we created.

```python
# ... imports, client, channel creation, and serial connection

with client.open_writer(
    # We need to provide a start time for the writer, which tells
    # Synnax where to begin writing data. We'll use the current time.
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    # The list of channels we'll be writing to.
    channels=["arduino_time", "arduino_value"]
    # Tell Synnax to immediately persist all recorded data for
    # historical access.
    enable_auto_commit=True
) as writer:
    while True:
        # Read from the serial connection
        value = float(ser.readline().decode("utf-8").rstrip())
        print(value)
        writer.write({
            # The timestamp of when the data was read
            "arduino_time": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            # The value read from the serial connection
            "arduino_value": value,
        })
```

Once we've finished these modifications, we can run the script and see the values
pouring in from the Arduino. Here's the entire script for reference:

<Details>
<Summary>`driver.py`</Summary>

```python
import synnax as sy
import serial

PORT = "/dev/ttyACM0"
BAUD_RATE = 9600

# Create the Synnax client
client = sy.Synnax(
    host="localhost",
    port=9090,
    username="synnax",
    password="seldon",
)

# Create the index channel
index_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="arduino_time",
    is_index=True,
    data_type="timestamp",
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)

# Create the data channel
data_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="arduino_value",
    index=index_channel.key,
    data_type="float32",
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)

# Set up the serial connection
ser = serial.Serial(PORT, BAUD_RATE)
if ser.is_open:
    print("Serial connection established")
else:
    print("Failed to establish serial connection")

# Open a writer and continuously read from the Arduino
with client.open_writer(
    start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
    channels=["arduino_time", "arduino_value"],
    enable_auto_commit=True
) as writer:
    while True:
        # Read from the serial connection
        value = float(ser.readline().decode("utf-8").rstrip())
        print(value)
        writer.write({
            "arduino_time": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
            "arduino_value": value,
        })
```

</Details>

### <StepText step="2.6" level="h3">Visualizing the Data</StepText>

While the script is still running, we can switch back to the Synnax Console and set up a
line plot to visualize the incoming data. To do this, we'll:

1. Hit the `+` button in the top right corner of the console's central mosaic.
2. Select the "Line Plot" component.
3. In visualization controls, choose the "Y1" axis and set the "Channel" to
   `arduino_value`.
4. In the "Ranges" section, choose the "Rolling 30s" range.

Here's a video demonstrating the process:

  id="guides/software/arduino/arduino-read-driver"
  themed={false}
/>

<Divider.Divider x />

## <StepText step={3} level="h2">Write-Only Driver</StepText>

Now that we've successfully read data from an analog input on the Arduino and written it
to Synnax, we'll go the other way and receive commands from Synnax to control the
digital outputs on the Arduino. We'll create this new driver in a file called
`driver_write.py`, although you're free to write over the previous file if you'd like.

### <StepText step="3.1" level="h3">Arduino Code</StepText>

We'll need to make new arduino code to receive commands over serial instead of sending
data. Here's the code we'll write:

```cpp
// Digital pin to control. We'll use the built in LED on pin 13, so that we can see the
// state of the pin without having to add an external component.
const int digitalPin = 13;

void setup() {
  // Set the baud rate to 9600 bps
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // Set the digital pin as an output
  pinMode(digitalPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Check if data is available to read
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    // Read the incoming byte
    char command = Serial.read();

    // If the command is '1', turn the pin on
    if (command == '1') {
      digitalWrite(digitalPin, HIGH);
      Serial.println("ON");
    }
    // If the command is '0', turn the pin off
    else if (command == '0') {
      digitalWrite(digitalPin, LOW);
      Serial.println("OFF");
    }
  }
  // Small delay to prevent overwhelming the serial connection
  delay(10);
}
```

As with the previous driver, we'll need to upload this code to the Arduino and verify
that it works.

### <StepText step="3.2" level="h3">Setting up the Serial Connection in Python</StepText>

We'll follow a very similar process to the previous driver to set up the serial
connection in Python. The only real difference is that we'll be reading from the serial
connection instead of writing to it.

```python
import synnax as sy
import serial

PORT = "/dev/ttyACM0"
BAUD_RATE = 9600

ser = serial.Serial(PORT, BAUD_RATE)
```

### <StepText step="3.3" level="h3">Creating the Relevant Synnax Channels</StepText>

In the previous driver, we created two channels: `arduino_time` and `arduino_value`. In
this command scenario, we'll only need to create one new channel: `arduino_command`.
This channel will be used to send commands from Synnax to the Arduino.

```python
# ... imports, client, and serial connection

# Create the command channel
command_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="arduino_command",
    data_type="uint8",
    virtual=True,
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)
```

### <StepText step="3.4" level="h3">Modifying the Loop to Write to Synnax</StepText>

Our run loop in this scenario will be the exact opposite of the previous driver. Instead
of reading from the serial connection, we'll be reading from the `arduino_command`
channel. Instead of writing to Synnax, we'll be writing to the serial connection.

```python
# ... imports, client, serial connection, and channel creation

with client.open_streamer(["arduino_command"]) as streamer:
    for frame in streamer:
        # Read from the command channel
        command = str(frame["arduino_command"][0])
        # Write to the serial connection
        ser.write(command.encode("utf-8"))
```

And that's it! We've now successfully created a write-only driver that can receive
commands from Synnax to control the digital output on the Arduino. We'll run our updated
script before we move into setting up the console. Here's the entire `driver_write.py`
script for reference:

<Details>
<Summary>`driver_write.py`</Summary>

```python
import synnax as sy
import serial

PORT = "/dev/ttyACM0"
BAUD_RATE = 9600

ser = serial.Serial(PORT, BAUD_RATE)

client = sy.Synnax(
    host="localhost",
    port=9090,
    username="synnax",
    password="seldon",
)

command_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="arduino_command",
    data_type="uint8",
    virtual=True,
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)

with client.open_streamer(["arduino_command"]) as streamer:
    for frame in streamer:
        command = str(frame["arduino_command"][0])
        ser.write(command.encode("utf-8"))
```

</Details>

### <StepText step="3.5" level="h3">Controlling the Arduino from the Console</StepText>

Now that we've uploaded the arduino code and started the Python script, we'll set up the
console with a switch on a [schematic](/reference/console/schematics) to control the
digital output on the Arduino:

1. Hit the `+` button in the top right corner of the console's central mosaic.
2. Select the "Schematic" component.
3. In the symbols library, we'll drag a switch onto the schematic.
4. In the "Properties" section, we'll go to the "Telemetry" tab.
5. We'll set both the "State" and "Command" channels to `arduino_command`.
6. We'll acquire control by hitting the "Acquire" button in the bottom right corner of
   the schematic.
7. We'll click the switch to turn the Arduino's LED on and off, and see the state
   updated in the console.

<Video
  client:only="react"
  id="guides/software/arduino/arduino-writer-driver"
  themed={false}
/>

<Divider.Divider x />

## <StepText step={4} level="h2">Read-Write Driver</StepText>

You may have found it strange that we set the "State" and "Command" fields on the switch
to the same channel. If that's the case, then why are there two separate fields? That's
because there's a more reliable way to set up command systems.

The **command** channel is what we send the enable/disable signal down when we click on
the switch, while the **state** channel is what we actually use to determine whether the
switch is on or off. For the sake of simplicity, we used the same channel for both.

The problem is that if we stop our driver and then click the switch, it will still turn
on and off as if everything was ok. So we think we're toggling on and off the switch,
but we're actually doing nothing.

The way to fix this is to create a new channel, called a **state channel** that will
reflect the actual value of the switch. We'll then use this state channel to toggle the
switch in the console.

In this section, we'll create a new driver that does three things:

1. Receives commands from Synnax to control the digital output on the Arduino.
2. Sends the state of the digital output back to Synnax.
3. Sends data from an analog input on the Arduino to Synnax.

### <StepText step="4.1" level="h3">Arduino Code</StepText>

We'll modify our previous Arduino code to both read and write over serial.

```cpp
const int digitalPin = 13;
const int analogPin = A0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(digitalPin, OUTPUT);
}

int state = 0;

void loop() {
    // Check if we've received a command over serial
    if (Serial.available() > 0) {
        // Read the incoming byte
        char command = Serial.read();
        // If the command is '1', turn the pin on
        if (command == '1') {
            digitalWrite(digitalPin, HIGH);
            state = 1;
        }
        // If the command is '0', turn the pin off
        else if (command == '0') {
            digitalWrite(digitalPin, LOW);
            state = 0;
        }
    }
    float analogValue = analogRead(analogPin);
    // Concatenate the state and analog value with a comma
    String output = String(state) + "," + String(analogValue);
    Serial.println(output);
    // Delay by 100ms, which means we'll roughly take measurements at 10Hz
    delay(10);
}
```

### <StepText step="4.2" level="h3">Modifying our Python Code</StepText>

To incorporate the new functionality, we'll need to modify our Python code to create
four channels: `arduino_command`, `arduino_state`, `arduino_time`, and `arduino_value`.

Both the `arduino_state` and `arduino_value` channels will be indexed by the
`arduino_time` channel, which we'll use to timestamp both the states and values.

```python
import synnax as sy
import serial

PORT = "/dev/ttyACM0"
BAUD_RATE = 9600

ser = serial.Serial(PORT, BAUD_RATE)

client = sy.Synnax(
    host="localhost",
    port=9090,
    username="synnax",
    password="seldon",
)

arduino_command = client.channels.create(
    name="arduino_command",
    data_type="uint8",
    virtual=True,
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)

arduino_time = client.channels.create(
    name="arduino_time",
    is_index=True,
    data_type="timestamp",
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)

arduino_state = client.channels.create(
    name="arduino_state",
    index=arduino_time.key,
    data_type="uint8",
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)

arduino_value = client.channels.create(
    name="arduino_value",
    index=arduino_time.key,
    data_type="float32",
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)
```

### <StepText step="4.3" level="h3">Modifying the Loop to Write to Synnax</StepText>

We'll need to modify our loop to read and write from both Synnax and the serial
connection. To kick things off, we'll open a streamer on the arduino command and a
writer on the remaining three channels.

```python
# ... imports, client, and channel creation

with client.open_streamer(["arduino_command"]) as streamer:
    with client.open_writer(
        start=sy.TimeStamp.now(),
        channels=["arduino_time", "arduino_state", "arduino_value"],
        enable_auto_commit=True
    ) as writer:
        while True:
            fr = streamer.read(timeout=0)
            if fr is not None:
                command = str(fr["arduino_command"][0])
                ser.write(command.encode("utf-8"))
            data = ser.readline().decode("utf-8").rstrip()
            if data:
                split = data.split(",")
                writer.write({
                    "arduino_time": sy.TimeStamp.now(),
                    "arduino_state": int(split[0]),
                    "arduino_value": float(split[1]),
                })
```

And that's it! We've now successfully created a read-write driver that can both control
the digital output on the Arduino and read the analog input. We'll run our updated
script before we move into setting up the console. Here's the entire
`driver_readwrite.py` script for reference:

<Details>
<Summary>`driver_readwrite.py`</Summary>

```python
import synnax as sy
import serial

PORT = "/dev/ttyACM0"
BAUD_RATE = 9600

ser = serial.Serial(PORT, BAUD_RATE)

client = sy.Synnax(
    host="localhost",
    port=9090,
    username="synnax",
    password="seldon",
)

arduino_command = client.channels.create(
    name="arduino_command",
    data_type="uint8",
    virtual=True,
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)
