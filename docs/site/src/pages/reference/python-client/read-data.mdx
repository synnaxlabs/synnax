The Python client supports several different ways of reading data from a
cluster. We can read directly from a channel, fetch a range and access its data,
or leverage server side iterators for processing large queries.

## Reading from a Channel

The simplest way to read data from Synnax is to use the `read` method on the `Channel`
class:

```python
from datetime import datetime

channel = client.channels.retrieve("my_precise_tc")

time_format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

start = datetime.strptime("2023-2-12 12:30:00", time_format)
end = datetime.strptime("2023-2-12 14:30:00", time_format)

data = channel.read(start, end)
```

The returned data is an instance of the `Series` class, but for all intents and
purposes can be treated exactly like a `numpy.ndarray`. For example, we can
perform vectorized operations on the data:

```python
data = data - 273.15
```

The `Series` class does give us some additional functionality. Most notably, we
can get the time range occupied by the data:

```python
tr = data.time_range
print(tr)
# 2023-02-12 12:30:00 - 2023-02-12 14:30:00
```

This method is important, as it's not always the case that data exists for the
entire time range queried.

## Reading from Multiple Channels

We can also read from multiple channels at once by calling the `read` method on
the `client`.  This method takes a list of channel names/keys and a time range:

```python
frame = client.read(start, end, ["my_precise_tc", "time"])
```

The returned data is an instance of the `Frame` class. We can access `Series` on
the class by using the `[]` operator:

```python
data = frame["my_precise_tc"]
```

We can also convert the `Frame` to a `pandas.DataFrame` by calling the `to_df`
method:

```python
df = frame.to_df()
```

## Reading Channel Data from a Range

While the above methods are useful for executing precise reads, they require us
to know the exact range of time we're interested in reading. [Ranges](ranges)
are a useful way of categorizing important time ranges in a cluster's data. We
can read directly from these ranges.

We can access channels on a `Range` object and call `read` on them to access
their data:

```python
rng = client.ranges.retrieve("My Interesting Test")

# Read the data from the channel
data = rng.my_precise_tc.read()

data = data - 273.15
```

It turns out that we don't even need to call the `read` method at all. We can
just use the channel name directly to perform operations on the data:

```python
data = rng.my_precise_tc - 273.15
```

We can also plot the data just as easily:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot time on the x-axis and temperature on the y-axis
plt.plot(rng.time, rng.my_precise_tc)
```

## Reading with Iterators

Single, multi, and named reads will cover most use cases, but there are
situations where it's necessary to process large volumes of data. Sometimes
these reads may be too large to fit in memory.

Synnax supports server side iterators that allow us to process large queries in
consistently sized chunks. By default, Synnax uses a chunk size of 100,000. To configure
a custom chunk size, pass in the `chunk_size` argument to the `open_iterator` method
with the desired number of samples per iteration.

```python
with client.open_iterator(start, end, "my_precise_tc", chunk_size=100) as it:
    for frame in it:
        # Do something with the frame
```
