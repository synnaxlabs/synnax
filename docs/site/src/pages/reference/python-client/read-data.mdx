## Reading from a Channel

## Reading from Multiple Channels

## Reading Channel Data from a Range

While the above methods are useful for executing precise reads, they require us to know
the exact range of time we're interested in reading.
[Ranges](/reference/python-client/ranges) are a useful way of categorizing important
time ranges in Synnax. We can read directly from these ranges.

We can access channels on a `Range` object and call `read` on them to access their data:

```python
rng = client.ranges.retrieve("My Interesting Test")

# Read the data from the channel
data = rng.my_precise_tc.read()

data = data - 273.15
```

It turns out that we don't even need to call the `read` method at all. We can just use
the channel name directly to perform operations on the data:

```python
data = rng.my_precise_tc - 273.15
```

We can also plot the data just as easily:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot time on the x-axis and temperature on the y-axis
plt.plot(rng.time, rng.my_precise_tc)
```

## Reading with Iterators

Single, multiple, and named reads will cover most use cases, but there are situations
where it's necessary to process more data than can be stored in memory.

Synnax supports server-side iterators that allow us to process large queries in
consistently sized chunks. By default, Synnax uses a chunk size of 100,000. To configure
a custom chunk size, pass in the `chunk_size` argument to the `open_iterator` method
with the desired number of samples per iteration.

```python
with client.open_iterator(start, end, "my_precise_tc", chunk_size=100) as it:
    for frame in it:
        # Do something with the frame
```

## Examples

Many of [our examples](/reference/python-client/examples) show how to effectively read
data from a Synnax Core. Some examples of note are:

- [Plot](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/plot.py)
  - Demonstrates how to plot data retrieved from a Synnax Core.
- [Export to CSV](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/export_to_csv.py)
  - Demonstrates how to export data retrieved from a Synnax Core to a CSV file.
- [Read Latest](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/read_latest.py)
  - Demonstrates how to read the latest x samples from a channel.
