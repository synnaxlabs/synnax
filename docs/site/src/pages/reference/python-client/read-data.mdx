The Python client supports several different ways of reading data from a cluster. We can
read directly from a channel, fetch a range and access its data, or leverage server-side
iterators for processing large queries. If you'd like a conceptual overview of how to
read data in Synnax, check out the [reads](/reference/concepts/reads) page.

## Reading from a Channel

The simplest way to read data from Synnax is to use the `read` method on the `Channel`
class:

```python
from datetime import datetime

channel = client.channels.retrieve("my_precise_tc")

time_format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

start = datetime.strptime("2023-2-12 12:30:00", time_format)
end = datetime.strptime("2023-2-12 14:30:00", time_format)

data = channel.read(start, end)
```

The returned data is an instance of the `Series` class, but for all intents and purposes
can be treated exactly like a `numpy.ndarray`. For example, we can perform vectorized
operations on the data:

```python
data = data - 273.15
```

The `Series` class does give us some additional functionality. Most notably, we can get
the time range occupied by the data:

```python
tr = data.time_range
print(tr)
# 2023-02-12 12:30:00 - 2023-02-12 14:30:00
```

This method is important, as it's not always the case that data exists for the entire
time range queried.

## Reading from Multiple Channels

We can also read from multiple channels at once by calling the `read` method on the
`client`. This method takes a list of channel names/keys and a time range:

```python
frame = client.read(start, end, ["my_precise_tc", "time"])
```

The returned data is an instance of the `Frame` class. We can access `Series` on the
class by using the `[]` operator:

```python
data = frame["my_precise_tc"]
```

We can also convert the `Frame` to a `pandas.DataFrame` by calling the `to_df` method:

```python
df = frame.to_df()
```

## Reading Channel Data from a Range

While the above methods are useful for executing precise reads, they require us to know
the exact range of time we're interested in reading.
[Ranges](/reference/python-client/ranges) are a useful way of categorizing important
time ranges in a cluster's data. We can read directly from these ranges.

We can access channels on a `Range` object and call `read` on them to access their data:

```python
rng = client.ranges.retrieve("My Interesting Test")

# Read the data from the channel
data = rng.my_precise_tc.read()

data = data - 273.15
```

It turns out that we don't even need to call the `read` method at all. We can just use
the channel name directly to perform operations on the data:

```python
data = rng.my_precise_tc - 273.15
```

We can also plot the data just as easily:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot time on the x-axis and temperature on the y-axis
plt.plot(rng.time, rng.my_precise_tc)
```

## Reading the Latest Data

Sometimes you need to read the most recent data from a channel without knowing the exact
timestamp. The `read_latest` method allows you to read the latest N samples from one or
more channels:

```python
# Read the latest single sample from a channel
latest_value = client.read_latest("my_precise_tc")

# Read the latest 10 samples from a channel
latest_samples = client.read_latest("my_precise_tc", n=10)

# Read the latest 5 samples from multiple channels
frame = client.read_latest(["my_precise_tc", "time", "pressure"], n=5)
```

The returned data follows the same conventions as regular reads - a `Series` for single
channels or a `Frame` for multiple channels.

## Reading with Iterators

Single, multiple, and named reads will cover most use cases, but there are situations
where it's necessary to process more data than can be stored in memory.

Synnax supports server-side iterators that allow us to process large queries in
consistently sized chunks. By default, Synnax uses a chunk size of 100,000. To configure
a custom chunk size, pass in the `chunk_size` argument to the `open_iterator` method
with the desired number of samples per iteration.

```python
with client.open_iterator(start, end, "my_precise_tc", chunk_size=100) as it:
    for frame in it:
        # Do something with the frame
```
