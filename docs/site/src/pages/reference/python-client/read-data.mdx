## Reading the Latest Data

## Reading with Iterators

Single, multiple, and named reads will cover most use cases, but there are situations
where it's necessary to process more data than can be stored in memory.

Synnax supports server-side iterators that allow us to process large queries in
consistently sized chunks. By default, Synnax uses a chunk size of 100,000. To configure
a custom chunk size, pass in the `chunk_size` argument to the `open_iterator` method
with the desired number of samples per iteration.

```python
with client.open_iterator(start, end, "my_precise_tc", chunk_size=100) as it:
    for frame in it:
        # Do something with the frame
```

<Divider.Divider x />

## Examples

Many of [our examples](/reference/python-client/examples) show how to effectively read
data from a Synnax Core. Some examples of note are:

- [Plot](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/plot.py)
  - Demonstrates how to plot data retrieved from a Synnax Core.
- [Export to CSV](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/export_to_csv.py)
  - Demonstrates how to export data retrieved from a Synnax Core to a CSV file.
- [Read Latest](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/read_latest.py)
  - Demonstrates how to read the latest x samples from a channel.
