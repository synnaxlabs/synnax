The Synnax TypeScript client supports multiple methods for writing data to a cluster. We
can write directly to a channel, or we can write to multiple channels in a streaming
fashion using a writer.

Writes in Synnax are more complicated than reads, and, as such, we recommend checking
out our [concepts](/reference/concepts/writes) page to learn more about writing data to
Synnax. The [rules of writes](/reference/concepts/writes#rules-of-writes) are especially
important.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Writing to a Channel

Writing to a channel requires us to write timestamps to its index channel before we
write the data. We'll create the following channels to use as examples:

```typescript
import { DataType } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const timeChannel = await client.channels.create({
  name: "time",
  dataType: DataType.TIMESTAMP,
  isIndex: true,
});

const temperatureChannel = await client.channels.create({
  name: "temperature",
  dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
  index: timeChannel.key,
});
```

We can then write data to `timeChannel` and `temperatureChannel`. We need to write to
the index channel before writing to the regular channel, so we will write to
`timeChannel` first. Writing data via the channel's `write` method requires a typed
array:

```typescript
import { TimeStamp, TimeSpan } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const start = TimeStamp.now();
const timestamps = new BigInt64Array([
  start.valueOf(), // valueOf() converts a TimeSpan to a bigint.
  start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(1)).valueOf(),
  start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(2)).valueOf(),
  start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(3)).valueOf(),
  start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(4)).valueOf(),
]);
const temperatures = new Float32Array([20.0, 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4]);

// Write the timestamps to the index first
await timeChannel.write(start, timestamps);
// Then write the data
await temperatureChannel.write(start, temperatures);
```

Notice how we align the two arrays by using the common `start` timestamp. This tells
Synnax that the first sample in the `temperatures` array is associated with the first
timestamp in the `timestamps` array, and so on.

Synnax will raise a `ValidationError` if the index does not contain a corresponding
timestamp for every sample in the data array. After all, it wouldn't make sense to have
a temperature reading without an associated timestamp.

## Using a Writer

While the above methods are great for writing static, existing data, it's common to want
to write data in a streaming fashion as it's acquired. This is useful for for use in
control sequences and live data processing. The `Writer` class is designed to handle
this use case (and is actually used under the hood by the above methods).

To keep things intuitive, we've designed the writer API around a file-like interface.
There are a few key differences, the most important being that writers are governed by a
transaction. If you'd like to learn more about transactions, see the
[concepts](/reference/concepts/writes) page.

We'll create the following channels to use as examples:

```typescript
import { DataType } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const timeChannel = await client.channels.create({
  name: "time",
  dataType: DataType.TIMESTAMP,
  isIndex: true,
});

const temperatureChannel = await client.channels.create({
  name: "temperature",
  dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
  index: timeChannel.key,
});
```

To open the writer, we'll use the `openWriter` method on the client:

```typescript
import { TimeStamp, Series, Frame } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const writer = await client.openWriter({
    start: TimeStamp.now(),
    channels: ["time", "temperature"]
});

try {
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        const start = TimeStamp.now();
        const timeSeries = BigInt64Array.from({ length: 10 }, (_, i) => (
            start.add(TimeSpan.milliseconds(i)).valueOf()
        ))
        const dataSeries = Float32Array.from({ length: 10 }, (_, i) => (
            Math.sin(i / 100)
        ))

        if (!await writer.write(new Frame({
            [timeChannel.key]: new Series(timeSeries),
            [temperatureChannel.key]: new Series(dataSeries)
        }))) {
            console.error("Failed to write");
            break;
        }
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
    }
    await writer.commit():
} finally {
    await writer.close()
}
```

This example will write 100 batches of 10 samples to the `temperature` channel, each
roughly 100ms apart, and will commit all writes when finished.

It's typical to write and commit millions of samples over the course of hours or days,
intermittently calling commit to ensure that the data is safely stored in the cluster.

### Closing the Writer

It's very important to free the writer resources when finished by calling the `close`
method. If `close` is not called at the end of the writer, other writers may not be able
to write to the same channels. We typically recommend placing the writer operations
inside a try-finally block to ensure that the writer is always closed.

### Different Ways of Writing Data

There are a number of argument formats that the `write` method accepts. Use the one that
best fits your use case.

```typescript
// Write a single sample for a channel
await writer.write("temperature", 20.0);

// Write multiple samples for a channel
await writer.write("temperature", [20.0, 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4]);

// Write a single sample for several channels
await writer.write({
  time: TimeStamp.now(),
  temperature: 20.0,
});

// Write multiple samples for several channels
const start = TimeStamp.now();
await writer.write({
  time: [start, start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(1))],
  temperature: [20.0, 20.1],
});

// Write typed arrays for several channels
await writer.write(
  new Frame({
    [timeChannel.key]: new BigInt64Array([
      start.valueOf(),
      start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(1)).valueOf(),
    ]),
    [temperatureChannel.key]: new Float32Array([20.0, 20.1]),
  }),
);
```

### Auto-Commit

You can configure a writer to automatically commit written data after each write, making
it immediately available for read access. To do this, set the `enableAutoCommit` option
to `true` when opening the writer:

```typescript
import { TimeStamp, Series, Frame } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const writer = await client.openWriter({
  start: TimeStamp.now(),
  channels: ["time", "temperature"],
  enableAutoCommit: true,
});

try {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    const start = TimeStamp.now();
    if (
      !(await writer.write(
        new Frame({
          time: start,
          temperature: Math.sin(i / 100),
        }),
      ))
    ) {
      console.error("Failed to write");
      break;
    }
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
  }
} finally {
  await writer.close();
}
```

### Write Authorities

Writers support dynamic control handoff. Multiple writers can be opened on a channel at
the same time, but only one writer is allowed to write to the channel. To determine
which writer has control, an authority from 0 to 255 is assigned to each writer (or,
optionally, each channel in the writer). The writer with the highest authority will be
allowed to write. If two writers have the same authority, the writer that opened first
will be allowed to write. For more information, see the
[concepts](/reference/concepts/writes#dynamic-control---write-authorities) page on
writers.

By default, writers are opened with an authority of `ABSOLUTE` i.e. 255. This means that
no other writers can write to the channel as long as the writer is open.

#### Opening a writer with the same authority on all channels

To open a writer with the same authority on all channels, you can pass the `authority`
argument with an integer.

```typescript
import { TimeStamp, Series, Frame } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const writer = await client.openWriter({
  start: TimeStamp.now(),
  channels: ["time", "temperature"],
  authority: 100,
});
```

#### Opening a writer with different authorities on each channel

To open a writer with different authorities on each channel, you can pass the
`authority` argument with a list of integers. This list must be the same length as the
number of channels in the writer.

```typescript
import { TimeStamp, Series, Frame } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const writer = await client.openWriter({
  start: TimeStamp.now(),
  channels: ["time", "temperature"],
  authority: [100, 200],
});
```

#### Adjusting write authorities after open

To change the authority of a writer during operation, you can use the `setAuthority`
method:

```typescript
// Set the authority on all channels
await writer.setAuthority(200);
// Set the authority on just a few channels
await writer.setAuthority({
  time: 200,
  temperature: 100,
});
```

### Persistence/Streaming Mode

By default, writers are opened in stream + persist
[mode](/reference/concepts/writes#persistencestreaming-modes). To change the mode of a
writer, specify the value of the `mode` argument when opening the writer. This can be
`persist`, `stream`, or `persistStream`.

For example, to open a writer that only persists data:

```typescript
import { TimeStamp, Series, Frame, WriterMode } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const writer = await client.openWriter({
  start: TimeStamp.now(),
  channels: ["time", "temperature"],
  mode: "persist",
});
```

### Error Handling

The Synnax writer is optimized for performance, and as such, does not synchronously
check for errors on every call to `write`. Instead, calls to `write` return a boolean
indicating whether the writer has accumulated any errors on the current call or on any
previous calls.

Once a writer has accumulated an error, all future calls to `write` will fail until the
writer is closed and a new writer is opened. When calls to `write` return `false`, you
should check for the accumulated error by calling `writer.error()` or simply close the
writer, at which point the error will be raised.

#### Error Handling Example - Out of Order Timestamps

Let's say we're writing a time series to a channel, but we accidentally write the
timestamps out of order. This is a common mistake that can be hard to debug. Here's how
we can use the writer to handle this:

```typescript
import { TimeStamp, TimeSpan, DataType } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const timeChannel = await client.channels.create({
  name: "time",
  dataType: DataType.TIMESTAMP,
  isIndex: true,
});

const dataChannel = await client.channels.create({
  name: "data",
  dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
  index: timeChannel.key,
});

const writer = await client.openWriter({
  start: TimeStamp.now(),
  channels: [timeChannel.key, dataChannel.key],
  enableAutoCommit: true,
});

try {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    // This will cause an error because timestamps are decreasing
    if (
      !(await writer.write({
        [timeChannel.key]: TimeStamp.now().subtract(TimeSpan.seconds(i)),
        [dataChannel.key]: i,
      }))
    ) {
      console.error("Write failed:", await writer.error());
      break;
    }
  }
} finally {
  await writer.close();
}
```

This will break out of the loop as soon as the writer encounters an out-of-order
timestamp. The error can be retrieved using `writer.error()`, and the writer will be
properly closed in the `finally` block.

## Common Pitfalls

There are several common pitfalls to avoid when writing data to a Synnax cluster. These
are important to avoid as they can lead to performance degradation and/or control
issues.

### Using Many Individual Write Calls Instead of a Writer

When writing large volumes of data in a streaming fashion (or in batches), it's
important to use a writer instead of making individual write calls to a channel. Calls
to `write` on a channel use an entirely new transaction for each call - constantly
creating, committing, and closing transactions has a dramatic impact on performance. So,
don't do this:

```typescript
time = await client.channels.retrieve("timestamps")
my_tc = await client.channels.retrieve("my_precise_tc")
# This is a very bad idea
for i in range(100):
    ts = TimeStamp.now()
    await time.write(ts, ts)
    await my_tc.write(ts, i)
```

This is also a bad idea:

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  const writer = await client.openWriter({
    start: TimeStamp.now(),
    channels: ["time", "temperature"],
    enableAutoCommit: true,
  });
  await writer.write({
    time: TimeStamp.now(),
    temperature: Math.sin(i / 100),
  });
  await writer.close();
}
```

Instead, repeatedly call `write` on a single writer:

```typescript
# This is dramatically more efficient
const writer = await client.openWriter({
    start: TimeStamp.now(),
    channels: ["time", "temperature"],
    enableAutoCommit: true
});
try {
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        if (!await writer.write({
            "time": TimeStamp.now(),
            "temperature": Math.sin(i / 100)
        })) {
            console.error("Failed to write");
            break;
        }
} finally {
    await writer.close();
}
```

### Calling Commit on Every Write

If you're not using auto-commit, it's important to call `commit` on the writer
periodically to ensure that the data is persisted to the cluster. However, calling
`commit` on every write is a bad idea. This is because `commit` requires a round-trip to
the cluster to ensure that the data is persisted. This can be very slow if you're
writing a lot of data. If you're writing a lot of data, commit every few seconds or turn
on auto-commit.

This is a bad idea:

```typescript
const writer = await client.openWriter({
  start: TimeStamp.now(),
  channels: ["time", "temperature"],
});
try {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    if (
      !(await writer.write({
        time: TimeStamp.now(),
        temperature: Math.sin(i / 100),
      }))
    ) {
      console.error("Failed to write");
      break;
    }
    await writer.commit();
  }
} finally {
  await writer.close();
}
```

Instead, use auto-commit:

```typescript
const writer = await client.openWriter({
  start: TimeStamp.now(),
  channels: ["time", "temperature"],
  enableAutoCommit: true,
});
try {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    if (
      !(await writer.write({
        time: TimeStamp.now(),
        temperature: Math.sin(i / 100),
      }))
    ) {
      console.error("Failed to write");
      break;
    }
} finally {
  await writer.close();
}
```
