The TypeScript client supports several different methods for reading data from a
cluster. We can read directly from a channel, read from multiple channels at
once, or use iterators to efficiently process large amounts of data.

## Reading from a Channel

The simplest way to read data from Synnax is to use the `read` method on a
`Channel` object:

```typescript
const channel = await client.channels.retrieve("temperature");
const start = new Date('2023-02-12T12:30:00Z');
const end = new Date('2022-02-12T14:30:00Z');

const series = await channel.read(start, end);
```

The returned data is a `MultiSeries`, which maintains a very similar interface
to a JavaScript typed array (e.g. `Float32Array`, `Int32Array`, etc.). We can
convert the returned data to a JavaScript array easily:

```typescript
const data = Array.from(series);
```

For more information on `MultiSeries` and their underlying `Series` object, see
[Series](series-and-frames#series).

## Reading from Multiple Channels

We can also read from multiple channels at once by calling the `read` method on
the client. This method takes a list of channel names/keys and a time range:

```typescript
import { TimeStamp } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto";

const start = TimeStamp.now();
const end = start.add(TimeStamp.seconds(10));
const frame = await client.read({ start, end }, ["temperature", "humidity"]);
```

The returned data is a `Frame` object, which contains a `MultiSeries` for each
channel. To access the data for a specific channel, we can use the `get` method:

```typescript
const temperature = frame.get("temperature");
const humidity = frame.get("humidity");
```

For more information on the `Frame` class, see [Frames](series-and-frames#frames).

## Using Iterators

While the above methods will cover most use cases, there are situations where
it's necessary to query large volumes of data. Iterators provide a way to
efficiently process data in chunks to avoid keeping large amounts of data in memory.
By default, Synnax uses a chunk size of 100,000 samples. To configure a
custom chunk size, set the `chunk_size` field in the options argument to the
`open_iterator` method with the desired number of samples per iteration.

```typescript
const start = TimeStamp.now();
const end = start.add(TimeStamp.seconds(10));

const iterator = await client.openIterator(
    { start, end },
    ["temperature", "humidity"],
    {
        chunkSize: 100,
    },
);
try {
    for await (const frame of iterator) {
        const temperature = frame.get("temperature");
        const humidity = frame.get("humidity");
        // Process the data
    }
} finally {
    iterator.close();
}
```

It's very important to `close` the iterator when you're done with it to free up
network resources. We highly recommend wrapping the iterator in a
`try...finally` block to ensure that it's closed properly in the event of an
error.
