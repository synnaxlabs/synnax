The TypeScript client supports several different methods for reading data from a
cluster. We can read directly from a channel, read from multiple channels at once, or
use iterators to efficiently process large amounts of data.

## Reading from a Channel

The simplest way to read data from Synnax is to use the `read` method on a `Channel`
object:

```typescript
const channel = await client.channels.retrieve("temperature");
const start = new Date("2023-02-12T12:30:00Z");
const end = new Date("2022-02-12T14:30:00Z");

const series = await channel.read(start, end);
```

The returned data is a
[`MultiSeries`](/reference/typescript-client/series-and-frames#series), which maintains
a very similar interface to a JavaScript typed array (e.g. `Float32Array`, `Int32Array`,
etc.). We can convert the returned data to a JavaScript array easily:

```typescript
const data = Array.from(series);
```

## Reading from Multiple Channels

We can also read from multiple channels at once by calling the `read` method on the
client. This method takes a list of channel names/keys and a time range:

```typescript
import { TimeStamp } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto";

const start = TimeStamp.now();
const end = start.add(TimeStamp.seconds(10));
const frame = await client.read({ start, end }, ["temperature", "humidity"]);
```

The returned data is a [`Frame`](/reference/typescript-client/series-and-frames#series)
object, which contains a `MultiSeries` for each channel. To access the data for a
specific channel, we can use the `get` method:

```typescript
const temperature = frame.get("temperature");
const humidity = frame.get("humidity");
```

## Using Iterators

While the above methods will cover most use cases, there are situations where it's
necessary to query large volumes of data. Iterators provide a way to efficiently process
data in chunks to avoid keeping large amounts of data in memory. By default, Synnax uses
a chunk size of 100,000 samples. To configure a custom chunk size, set the `chunk_size`
field in the options argument to the `open_iterator` method with the desired number of
samples per iteration.

```typescript
const start = TimeStamp.now();
const end = start.add(TimeStamp.seconds(10));

const iterator = await client.openIterator(
  { start, end },
  ["temperature", "humidity"],
  {
    chunkSize: 100,
  },
);
try {
  for await (const frame of iterator) {
    const temperature = frame.get("temperature");
    const humidity = frame.get("humidity");
    // Process the data
  }
} finally {
  iterator.close();
}
```

It's very important to `close` the iterator when you're done with it to free up network
resources. We highly recommend wrapping the iterator in a `try...finally` block to
ensure that it's closed properly in the event of an error.
