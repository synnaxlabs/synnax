The following sections outline common issues our users encounter when working with the
Synnax TypeScript client.

## Old Cluster Version

<div class="warning">

```
Synnax cluster node version is too old for client version x.x.x. This may cause
compatibility issues. We recommend upgrading the cluster.
```

are using is newer than the version of the Synnax cluster you are connecting to. To
resolve this issue, either [upgrade the Synnax cluster](/reference/cluster/installation)
or downgrade to a matching version of the client:

```sh
npm install @synnaxlabs/client@x.x.x
```
