The following sections outline common issues our users encounter when working with the
Synnax TypeScript client.

## Old Cluster Version

<div class="warning">

```
Synnax cluster node version is too old for client version x.x.x. This may cause
compatibility issues. We recommend upgrading the cluster.

resolve this issue, either [upgrade the Synnax cluster](/reference/core/installation) or
downgrade to a matching version of the client:

```sh
npm install @synnaxlabs/client@x.x.x
```
