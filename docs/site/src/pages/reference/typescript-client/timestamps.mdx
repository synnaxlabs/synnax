Working with high-resolution timestamps in JavaScript is tricky. We provide several
utility classes to make it easier.

<Divider.Divider x />

## JavaScript's Limitations

Synnax stores timestamps as 64-bit integers representing the number of nanoseconds
elapsed since the unix epoch in UTC. This is unlike JavaScript's native `Date` object,
which only supports millisecond precision.

Numbers in JavaScript are represented as 64-bit floating point numbers, which means that
they can only represent integers up to 2^53 accurately. This means that you may lose
precision for certain timestamps. Also, doing arithmetic with timestamps expressed as
floating point numbers can lead to rounding errors.

## TimeStamp

Synnax provides the `TimeStamp` utility class to effectively work with nanosecond
timestamps in JavaScript. It wraps a `bigint` to store a unix timestamp in nanoseconds.

### Constructing a TimeStamp

There are several easy ways to construct a `TimeStamp`:

```typescript
import { TimeStamp } from "@synnaxlabs/client";
// From the current time
const now = TimeStamp.now();
// From a Date object
const ts = new TimeStamp(new Date("2021-01-01T00:00:00Z"));
// From a string
const ts = new TimeStamp("2021-01-01T00:00:00Z");
// From a number of nanoseconds
const ts = new TimeStamp(1000000000);
// From a bigint of nanoseconds
const ts = new TimeStamp(BigInt(1000000000));
// From utility functions
const ts = TimeStamp.now().sub(TimeStamp.seconds(1));
```

Any of these formats can be passed to common methods used throughout the Synnax client.
The union of these formats is called a `CrudeTimeStamp`. Examples include `read`,
`write`, `openIterator`, `openStreamer`, and `openWriter`.

### Converting to a Date

You can convert a `TimeStamp` to a `Date` object using the `date` method:

```typescript
const ts = TimeStamp.now();
const date = ts.date();
```

### Arithmetic

You can perform arithmetic on `TimeStamp` objects:

```typescript
const ts1 = TimeStamp.now();
const ts2 = ts1.add(TimeStamp.seconds(1));
const diff = ts2.sub(ts1);
```

### Comparisons

You can compare `TimeStamp` objects:

```typescript
const ts1 = TimeStamp.now();
const ts2 = ts1.add(TimeStamp.seconds(1));
const isAfter = ts2.after(ts1);
const isAfterEq = ts2.afterEq(ts1);
const isBefore = ts1.before(ts2);
const isBeforeEq = ts1.beforeEq(ts2);
```

### Accessing the Underlying Value

You can access the underlying `bigint` value using the `value` property:

```typescript
const ts = TimeStamp.now();
const value = ts.value;
```

## TimeSpan

`TimeSpan` is a utility class that represents a duration of time. It wraps a `bigint` to
store a duration in nanoseconds.

### Constructing a TimeSpan

You can construct a `TimeSpan` directly from a number of nanoseconds, but it's generally
easier to use the utility functions:

```typescript
import { TimeSpan } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

// From a number of nanoseconds
const span = new TimeSpan(1000000000);
// From a utility function
const span = TimeSpan.hours(1);
// From multiple utility functions
const span = TimeSpan.days(1).add(TimeSpan.hours(1)).add(TimeSpan.minutes(1));
```

### Performing Arithmetic

You can perform arithmetic on `TimeSpan` objects:

```typescript
const span1 = TimeSpan.hours(1);
const span2 = span1.add(TimeSpan.minutes(1));
const diff = span2.sub(span1);
```

### Accessing the Underlying Value

You can access the underlying `bigint` value using the `value` property:

```typescript
const span = TimeSpan.hours(1);
const value = span.value;
```

## TimeRange

`TimeRange` is another utility class that represents a range of time. It consists of two
`TimeStamp` objects called `start` and `end`.

### Constructing a TimeRange

You can construct a `TimeRange` from two timestamps in any of the formats that
`TimeStamp` supports:

```typescript
import { TimeRange } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const start = TimeStamp.now();
const end = start.add(TimeStamp.seconds(1));
// From TimeStamp objects
const range = new TimeRange(start, end);
// From dates
const range = new TimeRange(
  new Date("2021-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
  new Date("2021-01-01T00:00:01Z"),
);
// From strings
const range = new TimeRange("2021-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2021-01-01T00:00:01Z");
// From numbers
const range = new TimeRange(1000000000, 2000000000);
// From bigints
const range = new TimeRange(BigInt(1000000000), BigInt(2000000000));
// From a mix of formats
const range = new TimeRange(BigInt(1000000000), "2021-01-01T00:00:01Z");
// From an object
const range = TimeRange.from({
  start: TimeStamp.now(),
  end: TimeStamp.now().add(TimeStamp.seconds(1)),
});
```

### Checking if a TimeStamp is in a TimeRange

You can check if a `TimeStamp` is in a `TimeRange` using the `contains` method:

```typescript
const range = new TimeRange(
  new Date("2021-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
  new Date("2021-01-01T00:00:01Z"),
);
const ts = new TimeStamp("2021-01-01T00:00:00.5Z");
const isIn = range.contains(ts);
console.log(isIn); // true
```

### Checking if Two TimeRanges Overlap

You can check if two `TimeRange` objects overlap using the `overlaps` method:

```typescript
const range1 = new TimeRange(
  new Date("2021-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
  new Date("2021-01-01T00:00:01Z"),
);
const range2 = new TimeRange(
  new Date("2021-01-01T00:00:00.5Z"),
  new Date("2021-01-01T00:00:01.5Z"),
);
const doesOverlap = range1.overlapsWith(range2);
console.log(doesOverlap); // true
```

### Getting the TimeSpan of a TimeRange

You can get the `TimeSpan` of a `TimeRange` using the `span` property:

```typescript
const range = new TimeRange(
  new Date("2021-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
  new Date("2021-01-01T00:00:01Z"),
);
const span = range.span;
console.log(span.seconds); // 1
```
