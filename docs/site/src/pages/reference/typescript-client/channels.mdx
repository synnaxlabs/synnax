The TypeScript client provides interfaces for creating, retrieving and deleting channels
in a Synnax Core. In this guide, we'll cover the details of each of these operations.

If you're unfamiliar with what channels are and how they work, check out the of
[channels concepts guide](/reference/concepts/channels).

## Creating Channels

We can create channels using the `channels.create` method on the client.

### Creating a Data Channel and its Index

Creating a data channel first requires us to create an index channel to store its
timestamps:

```typescript
import { DataType } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

// This channel is a special 'index' channel that is used to store timestamps for
// other channels.
const timeIndexChannel = await client.channels.create({
  name: "time",
  // Index channels must have a data type of TIMESTAMP and isIndex set to true
  dataType: DataType.TIMESTAMP,
  isIndex: true,
});

// This channel is used to store our actual data.
const tempChannel = await client.channels.create({
  name: "my_temp_sensor",
  dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
  // Pass the key of the index channel here
  index: timeIndexChannel.key,
});
```

Notice how we set the `isIndex` property to `true` on `timeIndexChannel`. This tells
Synnax that this channel will be used to store timestamps for other channels. We then
pass the `index` property to the `tempChannel` so it uses `timeIndexChannel` as its
index.

### Creating Multiple Channels

We can also create multiple channels efficiently by providing a list of channels to the
`create` method. This is far more efficient than creating channels individually, and
provides the atomic guarantee that either no or all channels will be created.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  When creating variable rate channels, keep in mind that we need to create index
  channels before we can create the channels that use them.
</Note.Note>

```typescript
import { Channel } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

// We need to create the index first, that way we can provide
// its key to our data channels.
const timeIndexChannel = await client.channels.create({
  name: "time",
  dataType: DataType.TIMESTAMP,
  isIndex: true,
});

const sensorOne = new Channel({
  name: "sensor_one",
  dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
  index: timeIndexChannel.key,
});

const sensorTwo = new Channel({
  name: "sensor_two",
  dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
  index: timeIndexChannel.key,
});

const sensorThree = new Channel({
  name: "sensor_three",
  dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
  index: timeIndexChannel.key,
});

const sensors = await client.channels.create([sensorOne, sensorTwo, sensorThree]);
```

## Retrieving Channels

We can retrieve channels using the `channels.retrieve` method on the client.

### Retrieving a Single Channel

To retrieve a single channel, we can pass the channel's name or key to the `retrieve`
method:

```typescript
// By name
const tempChannel = await client.channels.retrieve("my_temp_sensor");
// If you know the key, you can use that too
const tempChannel = await client.channels.retrieve(tempChannel.key);
```

If Synnax finds no channels matching the query, the client will raise a `NotFoundError`.
If more than one channel matches the query, the client will raise a
`MultipleFoundError`. If you'd like to accept no or multiple results, provide a list to
the `retrieve` method as shown in the next section.

### Retrieving Multiple Channels

We can also retrieve multiple channels by passing a list of names or keys to the
`retrieve` method:

```typescript
// By name
const channels = await client.channels.retrieve(["my_temp_sensor", "time"]);
// By key
const channels = await client.channels.retrieve([
  tempChannel.key,
  timeIndexChannel.key,
]);
// This won't work!!
const channels = await client.channels.retrieve([
  "my_temp_sensor",
  timeIndexChannel.key,
]);
```

Synnax will not raise a `NotFoundError` if no channels match the query. Instead, it will
simply omit that channel from the list of results.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Deleting Channels

To delete a channel, we can use the `channels.delete` method on the client:

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  Deleting a channel will also delete all of the data stored in that channel. This is a
  permanent operation that cannot be undone. Be careful!
</Note.Note>

```typescript
// Delete a single channel
await client.channels.delete("my_precise_tc");
// Delete multiple channels
await client.channels.delete(["sensor_one", "sensor_two"]);
// Delete by key
await client.channels.delete(sensor_three.key);
// Delete many by key
await client.channels.delete([sensor_one.key, sensor_two.key, sensor_three.key]);
```

Unlike with retrieving channels, Synnax will not raise an error if it cannot find a
channel matching the key or name. This means that `delete` is an idempotent operation,
and is safe to call even if the channel has already been deleted.

Deleting a channel by name will delete **all** channels with that name.
