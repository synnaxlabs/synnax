Streaming data is useful for real-time processing, visualization, and monitoring. This
page guides you through using the TypeScript client to stream data from a Synnax
cluster. If you'd like a conceptual overview of how streams work in Synnax, check out
the [streams](/reference/concepts/streams) page.

## Open a Streamer

To start streaming data, call the `openStreamer` method on the client and provide a list
of channels to stream:

```typescript
const streamer = await client.openStreamer(["temperature1", "temperature2"]);
```

## Reading Frames

Then, to read the next incoming data frame, call the `read` method on the streamer:

```typescript
const frame = await streamer.read();
```

This call will block until a new frame is available. **This frame may not contain data
for every channel specified**. For example, if we're reading from two sensors that are
being sampled by different devices at different rates, we may receive a frame containing
data only for the first channel, followed by a frame containing data only for the second
channel.

For more details on how to work with the returned frames, see the
[Series and Frames](/reference/typescript-client/series-and-frames) page.

### Downsampling

If you are interested in streaming data at a lower rate, you can use the optional
`downsampleFactor` parameter. This parameter will cause the streamer to skip the
specified number of samples in each series before returning the next frame. Note that
this parameter does not average values, and will skip samples instead.

For example, if you set the downsample factor to 2, every 2nd sample will be retained.

```typescript
const streamer = await client.openStreamer({
  channels: ["temperature1", "temperature2"],
  downsampleFactor: 2,
});
```

### Handling Partial Frames

When reading frames from a streamer, it's important to note that a frame may not contain
data for every channel specified when opening the streamer. For example, if we're
reading from two sensors, `temperature` and `pressure`, that are being sampled by
different devices at different rates, we may receive a frame containing data only for
the first channel, followed by a frame containing only data for the second channel.

```typescript
const frame = await streamer.read();
console.log(frame.at(-1));
// Output: { temperature: 25.0 }
const frame2 = await streamer.read();
console.log(frame2.at(-1));
// Output: { pressure: 1000.0 }
const frame3 = await streamer.read();
console.log(frame3.at(-1));
// Output: { temperature: 25.0, pressure: 1000.0 }
```

To check if a frame contains data for a specific channel, you can use the `has` method:

```typescript
const frame = await streamer.read();
if (frame.has("temperature")) console.log(frame.get("temperature"));
```

### Using an Async For Loop

The streamer implements an async iterator, which can be useful for continuously
processing incoming frames of data:

```typescript
for await (const frame of streamer) {
  // Process the frame
  const latestSamples = frame.at(-1);
}
```

## Updating the Channel List

If you need to update the list of channels being streamed, you can call the `update`
method on the streamer:

```typescript
await streamer.update(["temperature1", "temperature2", "pressure"]);
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  This method will *replace* the current list of channels with the new list, not add to
  it.
</Note.Note>

## Closing the Streamer

After you're done streaming, it's essential that you call the `close` method on the
streamer to release the network connection and other related resources:

```typescript
streamer.close();
```

We recommend using the `streamer` object within a `try-finally` block when possible.
This ensures that the streamer is always closed, even if an exception is thrown:

```typescript
const streamer = await client.openStreamer(["temperature1", "temperature2"]);
try {
  for await (const frame of streamer) {
    // Process the frame
  }
} finally {
  streamer.close();
}
```
