Streaming data is useful for real-time processing, visualization, and
monitoring. This page guides you through using the TypeScript client to stream
data from a Synnax cluster. If you'd like a conceptual overview of how streams work in 
Synnax, check out the [streams](/reference/concepts/streams) page.

## Open a Streamer

To start streaming data, call the `openStreamer` method on the client and
provide a list of channels to stream:

```typescript
const streamer = await client.openStreamer(["temperature1", "temperature2"]);
```

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Reading Frames

Then, to read the next incoming data frame, call the `read` method on the streamer:

```typescript
const frame = await streamer.read();
```

This call will block until a new frame is available. **This frame may not
contain data for every channel specified**. For example, if we're reading from
two sensors that are being sampled by different devices at different rates, we
may receive a frame containing data only for the first channel, followed by a
frame containing data only for the second channel.

For more details on how to work with the returned frames, see the [Series and Frames](series-and-frames) page.

### Using an Async For Loop

The streamer implements an async iterator, which can be useful for continuously
processing incoming frames of data:

```typescript
for await (const frame of streamer) {
  // Process the frame
  const latestSamples = frame.at(-1);
}
```

<Divider.Divider direction="x"/>

## Closing the Streamer

After you're done streaming, it's essential that you call the `close` method on
the streamer to release the network connection and other related resources:

```typescript
streamer.close();
```

We recommend using the `streamer` object within a `try-finally` block when possible. This
ensures that the streamer is always closed, even if an exception is thrown:

```typescript
const streamer = await client.openStreamer(["temperature1", "temperature2"]);
try {
  for await (const frame of streamer) {
    // Process the frame
  }
} finally {
  streamer.close();
}
```
