import { Divider } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto"
import Code from "@/components/code/Code.astro";
export const components = { pre: Code };

## Installation

The TypeScript client is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@synnaxlabs/client),
and can be installed with your package manager of choice. We'll be using `npm`
in our documentation, but feel free to use `yarn`, `pnpm`, or any other package
manager you prefer.

```cmd
npm install @synnaxlabs/client
```

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Authenticating with a Cluster

To authenticate with a Synnax cluster, simply instantiate a new client with your 
connection parameters and credentials:

```typescript
import { Synnax } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const client = new Synnax({
    host: "demo.synnaxlabs.com",
    port: 9090,
    username: "synnax",
    password: "seldon",
    secure: true,
});
```

Here's a breakdown of the parameters you can pass to the client:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `host` | The hostname of the Synnax cluster | `localhost` |
| `port` | The port of the Synnax cluster | `9090` |
| `username` | The username to authenticate with | `""` |
| `password` | The password to authenticate with | `""` |
| `secure` | Whether to use TLS encryption. This should be set to `true` if the cluster is using TLS. See [production](../cluster/production) for more information. | `false` |

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed and authenticated the client, you're ready to start
using Synnax! We recommend starting with the [Channels](channels) section to
learn how to create channels and retrieve data from them.
