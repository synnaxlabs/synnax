import { Divider } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto";
import { mdxOverrides } from "@/components/mdxOverrides";
export const components = mdxOverrides;

## Installation

The TypeScript client is available on
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@synnaxlabs/client), and can be installed with your
package manager of choice. We'll be using `npm` in our documentation, but feel free to
use `yarn`, `pnpm`, or any other package manager you prefer.

```cmd
npm install @synnaxlabs/client
```

<Divider.Divider x />

## Authenticating with a Core

To authenticate with a Synnax Core, simply instantiate a new client with your connection
parameters and credentials:

```typescript
import { Synnax } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const client = new Synnax({
  host: "demo.synnaxlabs.com",
  port: 9090,
  username: "synnax",
  password: "seldon",
  secure: true,
});
```

Here's a breakdown of the parameters you can pass to the client:

| Parameter  | Description                       | Default     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `host`     | The hostname of the Synnax Core   | `localhost` |
| `port`     | The port of the Synnax Core       | `9090`      |
| `username` | The username to authenticate with | `""`        |
| `password` | The password to authenticate with | `""`        |
| `secure`   | Whether to use TLS encryption.    | `false`     |
