Series and frames are the two fundamental structures used for working with channel data
in Synnax. This guide will walk you through how to use the `Frame` and `Series` classes
exposed by the TypeScript client.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Series

A series is a strongly typed array of samples. A series can contain any data you want it
to, but in the context of Synnax it almost always represents a set of contiguous samples
from a single channel.

### Constructing a Series

Here are a few simple ways to construct a series:

```typescript
import { Series } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

// Construct a series from an array of numbers. In this case, the series will
// automatically be of type float64.
const series = new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

// Construct a series from an array of numbers, but this time we specify the type
// explicitly.
const series = new Series({ data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dataType: "float32" });

// Construct a series from an array of strings. In this case, the series will
// automatically be of type string.
const series = new Series(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]);

// Construct a series from a Float32Array. This is the most efficient way to
// construct a series from a large amount of data.
const series = new Series(new Float32Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));

// Construct a series from a JSON object. This is useful when you have a series
// that has been serialized to JSON.
const series = new Series([
  { red: "cherry" },
  { yellow: "banana" },
  { orange: "orange" },
]);
```

The values passed to a series cannot have different data types. The constructor will not
throw an error, as validating data types is an expensive operation, but the series will
not behave as expected:

```typescript
const series = new Series([1, "a", 3, "b", 5]);
```

### Accessing Data

#### The at method

The easiest way to access data from a series is to use the `at` method. This method
behaves the same as the `at` method on a Javascript array, and allows for negative
indexing:

```typescript
const series = new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

console.log(series.at(0)); // 1
console.log(series.at(-1)); // 5
```

#### The as method

An important caveat of `at` is that its return type will be a Synnax `TelemValue` type,
which is a union of all the possible data types that a series can contain:

```typescript
import { TelemValue } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const series = new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
// Is it a number? Is it a string? Who knows?
const v: TelemValue = series.at(0);
```

This can make it difficult to write type-safe code when working with a series. If you
know that a series should be of a certain JavaScript type (`number`, `string`, `object`,
`bigint`), you can use the `as` method to validate the data type and return a
`Series<T>` of that type:

```typescript
const series = new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
const easierSeries: Series<number> = series.as("number");
// Now we have a guarantee that this is a series of numbers.
const v: number = easierSeries.at(0);
```

#### Accessing a TypedArray

You use the `data` attribute to get the a `TypedArray` representation of the series:

```typescript
const series = new Series({ data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dataType: "int8" });
const ta = series.data;
console.log(ta); // Int8Array [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
```

Note that while this method will work for `string` and `json` series, the returned typed
array will be a `Uint8Array` representing the encoded data.

### Converting to a Javascript Array

Series implement the `Iterable` interface, so you can use the spread operator to convert
a series to a Javascript array, or use the `Array.from` method:

```typescript
const series = new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
const jsArray = [...series];
console.log(jsArray); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
const jsArray2 = Array.from(series);
console.log(jsArray2); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
```

This method will also work for `json` and `string` encoded series:

```typescript
const series = new Series([{ red: "cherry", yellow: "banana", orange: "orange" }]);
const jsArray = [...series];
console.log(jsArray); // [ { red: 'cherry', yellow: 'banana', orange: 'orange' } ]
```

### The Time Range Property

Whenever you read a series from Synnax, it will have a `timeRange` property that
represents the time range occupied by the samples in the Series. This method can be
useful for getting a high-level understanding of when the samples were recorded without
needing to query an index channel.

The `start` field represents the timestamp for the first sample, and the `end` field
represents a timestamp just after the last sample (start-inclusive, end-exclusive).

We can also define a time range when constructing the series:

```typescript
import { TimeRange, TimeStamp, TimeSpan } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const start = TimeStamp.now();

const series = new Series({
  data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  dataType: "float64",
  timeRange: new TimeRange({ start, end: start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(6)) }),
});
```

### Other Useful Properties

#### Length

The `length` property returns the number of samples in the series:

```typescript
const series = new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
console.log(series.length); // 5

const stringSeries = new Series(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]);
console.log(stringSeries.length); // 3
```

#### Data type

The `dataType` property returns the data type of the series:

```typescript
import { DataType } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const series = new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
console.log(series.dataType.toString()); // "float64"
console.log(series.dataType.equals(DataType.STRING)); // true
```

#### Max, min, and bounds

The `max`, `min`, and `bounds` properties are intelligently cached properties that
return the maximum, minimum, or both values of the series. These properties only work
with numeric series:

```typescript
const series = new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
console.log(series.max); // 5
console.log(series.min); // 1
console.log(series.bounds); // { lower: 1, upper: 5 }
```

## Frames

A frame is a collection of series from multiple channels. Frames are returned by

- The `read` method of the Synnax data client (`client.read`)
- The `read` method of a `Streamer` instance (`client.openStreamer`)
- The `value` property of an `Iterator` instance (`client.openIterator`)

### Constructing a Frame

A frame maps the key or name of a channel to one or more series. Here are a few examples
of how to construct a frame:

```typescript
import { Frame } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

// Construct a frame for the given channel names.
const frame = new Frame({
  channel1: new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),
  channel2: new Series([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]),
  channel3: new Series([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]),
});

// Construct a frame for the given channel keys
const frame = new Frame({
  1: new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),
  2: new Series([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]),
  // Notice that series do not need to be the same length.
  3: new Series([1, 1, 1]),
});

// Construct a frame from a map
const frame = new Frame(
  new Map([
    ["channel1", new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])],
    ["channel2", new Series([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])],
    ["channel3", new Series([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])],
  ]),
);

// Or from an array of keys and series
const frame = new Frame(
  ["channel1", "channel2", "channel3"],
  [
    new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),
    new Series([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]),
    new Series([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]),
  ],
);

// Or construct a frame with multiple series for a single channel
const frame = new Frame({
  channel1: [
    new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),
    new Series([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]),
    new Series([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]),
  ],
  channel2: [new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])],
});
```

### Accessing Frame Data

#### The get method

The easiest way to access data from a frame is to use the `get` method. This method
return an instance of a `MultiSeries` class, which is a special type of series that
wraps multiple `Series` instances, but behaves much like a `Series` instance:

```typescript
import { MultiSeries } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const frame = new Frame({
  channel1: [new Series([1, 2]), new Series([3, 4, 5])],
  channel2: new Series([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]),
  channel3: new Series([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]),
});

const multiSeries: MultiSeries = frame.get("channel1");
// Access a value
console.log(multiSeries.at(0)); // 1

// Access a value from a specific series
console.log(multiSeries.series[0].at(0)); // 1

// Construct a Javascript array from the MultiSeries
const jsArray = [...multiSeries];
console.log(jsArray); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
```

#### The at method

The `at` method can be used to access a JavaScript object containing a single value for
each channel in the frame:

```typescript
const frame = new Frame({
  channel1: new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),
  channel2: new Series([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]),
  channel3: new Series([1, 1]),
});

const obj = frame.at(3);
console.log(obj); // { channel1: 1, channel2: 5, channel3: undefined }
```

If you set the `required` parameter to `true`, the method will throw an error if any of
the channels are missing:

```typescript
const frame = new Frame({
  channel1: new Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),
  channel2: new Series([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]),
  channel3: new Series([1, 1]),
});

const obj = frame.at(3, true); // Throws an error
```
