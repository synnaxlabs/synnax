The Synnax Driver uses a mixture of mechanisms to ensure that timestamps for acquired
samples are as accurate as possible.

### Most Recent Samples Over All Samples

The Synnax Driver is used for low-latency control. For this reason, the Driver will
always prefer collecting the most recent samples over collecting all samples. This is
particularly relevant when collecting samples from devices whose communication
mechanisms can fluctuate or be unstable (i.e. USB).

Under heavy load, the Driver will intentionally drop samples in order to keep up with
the acquisition rate of the device.

## Hardware Timed Tasks

Where possible, the Driver will leverage sample clocks on the hardware data acquisition
module itself to provide the most accurate timestamps possible. In hardware-timed mode,
the Driver uses the clock rate of the module to interpolate the time difference between
samples.

Hardware timing is used for LabJack Read Tasks and NI Analog Read Tasks.

For example, we have a task with a sample rate of 100 Hz, and a stream rate of 10 Hz.
This means that we'll acquire 10 samples on every read from the module. Assuming that we
started the task at absolute time 0, this is what the timestamps would look like:

| Sample Index | Time (s) | Notes                       |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------- |
| 0            | 0.000    | First sample of first read  |
| 1            | 0.010    |                             |
| 2            | 0.020    |                             |
| 3            | 0.030    |                             |
| 4            | 0.040    |                             |
| 5            | 0.050    |                             |
| 6            | 0.060    |                             |
| 7            | 0.070    |                             |
| 8            | 0.080    |                             |
| 9            | 0.090    | Last sample of first read   |
| 10           | 0.100    | First sample of second read |
| ...          | ...      | ...                         |
| 19           | 0.190    | Last sample of second read  |
| 20           | 0.200    | First sample of third read  |

### Skew Correction

While assuming that timestamps are evenly distributed is a very good approximation, the
reality is that acquisition rates may fluctuate over time. This can happen for several
reasons:

- The Driver runs on a non-real-time operating system, meaning that individual
  acquisition loops may take longer or shorter than the specified stream rate.
- Minor differences between the hardware sample clock and the specified sample rate may
  cause accumulated errors over time.
- Unreliability in the data transport mechanism or heavy system load may cause the
  Driver or transport mechanism to skip samples.

These factors mean that clock drift may accumulate over time, causing the evenly
distributed timestamps generated by the hardware clock to deviate from the system time
of the host machine running the Driver.

To correct for this, the Driver implements a skew correction algorithm that periodically
makes minor corrections to the spacing between samples in order to ensure that the
timestamps accurately represent the time the samples were acquired, and that the
acquisition task stays aligned with the system clock.

As an additional benefit, the skew correction algorithm also ensures that hardware timed
tasks stay aligned with other software timed task running on the same Driver. For
example, valve timings generated by a software-timed digital write task will remain
closely aligned with the hardware-timed samples from an analog input task.

Skew correction is enabled by default, but can be disabled by setting the `correct_skew`
option to `false` in the Driver configuration file, setting `--correct-skew=false` on
the command line, or by setting the `SYNNAX_DRIVER_CORRECT_SKEW` environment variable to
`false`.

## Software Timed Tasks

When hardware timing is not available, the Driver will resort to using the system clock
in order to generate timestamps. This is less accurate than hardware timing, as samples
are timestamped when they are received by the Driver, rather than when they are acquired
the hardware.

Software timed clocks are used for NI Digital Read Tasks, NI Digital Write Tasks,
LabJack Write Tasks, OPC UA Read Tasks, and Modbus Read Tasks.
