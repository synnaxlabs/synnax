## <StepText step="1" level="h2">Installation</StepText>

To get started, you'll need to install the Synnax Driver. Choose your operating system
below to see the installation instructions:

<Tabs exclude={["docker"]} client:only="react">
<Fragment slot="ni-linux-rt">

### Prerequisites

#### Supported Hardware & Software

The Synnax Driver supports the cRIO-904x and cRIO-905x families of controllers running
NI Linux Real-Time 2024 Q1 and later.

#### NI-DAQmx Programming Mode

Data acquisition hardware connected to the cRIO must be configured to use the NI-DAQmx
real-time programming mode.

To change the programming mode, use NI Measurement & Automation Explorer (NI MAX). For
detailed instructions, see the
[NI CompactRIO User Manual](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/ni-compactrio/page/programming-modes.html)
and the
[NI-DAQmx on CompactRIO](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/compactrio/what-are-compactrio-controllers/what-is-compactrio-with-ni-daqmx-.html)
guide.

#### SSH Access

The easiest way to install the Driver is to use an SSH connection to the cRIO. Once the
Driver is installed, SSH can be disabled, although we recommend keeping it enabled to
install updates and manage the Driver.

#### Network Available Synnax Core

In order to function properly, the Driver must be able to connect to a Synnax Core
running on the same network. Make sure you have a
[Core running](/reference/core/quick-start) and have the connection parameters on hand.

### Install and Run the Driver

Installing the Driver is as simple as opening an SSH connection to the cRIO and running
the following command:

<DownloadURL os="ni-linux-rt" />

This will download, install, and start the Driver. Once the Driver is installed, we'll
need to configure it to connect to your Core.

</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="Linux">

### Install and Run the Driver

To install the Synnax Driver on a Linux distribution, run the following command to
download the latest binary:

<DownloadURL os="linux" />

We recommend you move the binary into a directory that is in your `PATH`. Most of our
users use `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
sudo mv synnax-driver-* /usr/local/bin/synnax-driver
```

If `usr/local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, you can temporarily add it by running the
following:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

Or, you can add it permanently using the following one-liner for your shell:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Or, for `zsh`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Next, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax-driver
```

You may need to use `sudo` to run the above command if you do not have the necessary
permissions.

To verify that the installation was successful, run:

```bash
synnax-driver --version
```

</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="Windows">

### Install and Run the Driver

Download the latest Synnax Driver executable for Windows:

<DownloadURL os="windows" />

After downloading, move the `synnax-driver.exe` file to a location on your system, such
as `C:\Program Files\Synnax\`.

To make the Driver accessible from any command prompt, add the directory to your
system's `PATH`:

1. Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables"
2. Click "Edit the system environment variables"
3. Click the "Environment Variables" button
4. Under "System variables", find and select "Path", then click "Edit"
5. Click "New" and add the directory containing `synnax-driver.exe`
6. Click "OK" to save

To verify that the installation was successful, open a new PowerShell terminal and run:

```powershell
synnax-driver --version
```

</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="macOS">

### Install and Run the Driver

To install the Synnax Driver on macOS, run the following command to download the latest
binary:

<DownloadURL os="macos" />

We recommend you move the binary into a directory that is in your `PATH`. Most of our
users use `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
sudo mv synnax-driver-* /usr/local/bin/synnax-driver
```

If `usr/local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, you can temporarily add it by running the
following:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

Or, you can add it permanently using the following one-liner for your shell:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Next, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax-driver
```

You may need to use `sudo` to run the above command if you do not have the necessary
permissions.

To verify that the installation was successful, run:

```bash
synnax-driver --version
```

## <StepText step="2" level="h2">Connect to the Synnax Core</StepText>

To connect to a Core, you'll need to know the Core's IP address, port, username, and
password. Then run the `synnax-driver login` command:

```bash
synnax-driver login
```

This will prompt you to enter the Core's connection parameters. Once you've entered the
parameters, the Driver will automatically connect to the Core. Here's an example of the
output:

```
synnax-driver login
host (default: localhost): 10.0.0.45
port (default: 9090): 9090
username: synnax
password:
I20250318 04:57:06.681439 25261 login.cpp:47] connecting to Synnax at 10.0.0.45:9090
I20250318 04:57:06.792840 25261 login.cpp:53] successfully logged in!
I20250318 04:57:06.793918 25261 login.cpp:59] credentials saved successfully
```

## <StepText step="3" level="h2">Check the Driver Status</StepText>

As a final step, you can check the Driver's status by running the `synnax-driver status`
command:

```bash
synnax-driver status
```

This will print the Driver's status to the console. Here's an example of the output:

```
I20250318 05:07:04.312907  5935 daemon_nilinuxrt.cpp:490] Checking service status
I20250318 05:07:04.346398  5937 version.cpp:21] Synnax Driver v0.39.0 (2025-03-16 00:08:18)
Synnax Driver is running (PID: 28191)
```

## Configuration Methods

In addition to using the `synnax-driver login` command, the Synnax Driver also allows
you to configure parameters for the Driver via a configuration file and/or environment
variables.

### Precedence

The precedence of the different configuration methods is as follows, with earlier
methods taking precedence over later ones:

1. Command line arguments (Highest)
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration file
4. Parameters passed to the `synnax-driver login` command
5. Internal defaults (Lowest)

### Configuration File

The Synnax Driver can optionally read connection parameters from a JSON configuration
file with the following format:

```json
{
  // Connection parameters
  "connection": {
    // The host of the Synnax Core.
    "host": "localhost",
    // The port of the Synnax Core.
    "port": 9090,
    // The username to use when logging in to the Synnax Core.
    "username": "synnax",
    // The password to use when logging in to the Synnax Core.
    "password": "password",
    // The path to the CA certificate file to use when connecting
    // to the Synnax Core. This is only required if the Core
    // is configured to use TLS.
    "ca_cert_file": "/path/to/ca.crt",
    // The path to the client certificate file to use when connecting
    // to the Synnax Core. This is only required when the Core is
    // configured to use TLS and client certificates for authentication.
    "client_cert_file": "/path/to/client.crt",
    // The path to the client key file to use when connecting to the
    // Synnax Core. This is only required when the Core is configured
    // to use TLS and client certificates for authentication.
    "client_key_file": "/path/to/client.key"
  },
  "timing": {
    // Enable automatic skew correction for the Driver.
    "correct_skew": true
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

The Synnax Driver also supports setting connection parameters via environment variables.

```bash
# The host of the Synnax Core.
export SYNNAX_DRIVER_HOST=localhost
# The port of the Synnax Core.
export SYNNAX_DRIVER_PORT=9090
# The username to use when logging in to the Synnax Core.
export SYNNAX_DRIVER_USERNAME=synnax
# The password to use when logging in to the Synnax Core.
export SYNNAX_DRIVER_PASSWORD=password
# The path to the CA certificate file to use when
# connecting to the Synnax Core. This is only required
# if the Core is configured to use TLS.
export SYNNAX_DRIVER_CA_CERT_FILE=/path/to/ca.crt
# The path to the client certificate file to use when
# connecting to the Synnax Core. This is only required when
# the Core is configured to use TLS and client certificates
# for authentication.
export SYNNAX_DRIVER_CLIENT_CERT_FILE=/path/to/client.crt
# The path to the client key file to use when connecting to
# the Synnax Core. This is only required when the Core is
# configured to use TLS and client certificates for authentication.
export SYNNAX_DRIVER_CLIENT_KEY_FILE=/path/to/client.key
# Enable automatic clock skew correction for the Driver.
export SYNNAX_DRIVER_CORRECT_SKEW=true
