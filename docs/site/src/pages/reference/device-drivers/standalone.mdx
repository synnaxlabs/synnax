The standalone driver makes it possible to integrate data acquisition hardware from
multiple host machines into a single Synnax deployment.

## <StepText step="1" level="h2">Installation</StepText>

To get started, you'll need to install the Synnax standalone driver. Choose your
operating system below to see the installation instructions:

<Tabs exclude={["docker", "windows", "macOS"]} client:only="react">
<Fragment slot="ni-linux-rt">

### Prerequisites

#### Supported Hardware & Software

The Synnax standalone driver supports the cRIO-904x and cRIO-905x families of
controllers running NI Linux Real-Time 2024 Q1 and later.

#### NI-DAQmx Programming Mode

Data acquisition hardware connected to the cRIO must be configured to use the NI-DAQmx
real-time programming mode.

To change the programming mode, use NI Measurement & Automation Explorer (MAX). For
detailed instructions, see the [NI CompactRIO User
Manual](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/ni-compactrio/page/programming-modes.html)
and the [NI-DAQmx on CompactRIO](https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails)
guide.

#### SSH Access

The easiest way to install the Synnax standalone driver is to use an SSH connection to
the cRIO. Once the driver is installed, SSH can be disabled, although we recommend
keeping it enabled to install updates and manage the driver.

#### Network Available Cluster

In order to function properly, the standalone driver must be able to connect to a Synnax
cluster running on the same local network. Make sure you have a [cluster
running](/reference/cluster/quick-start) and have the connection parameters on hand.

### Install and Run the Driver

Installing the Synnax standalone driver is as simple as opening an SSH connection to the
cRIO and running the following command:

<DownloadURL os="ni-linux-rt" />

This will download, install, and start the Synnax standalone driver. Once the driver is
installed, we'll need to configure it to connect to your cluster.

### Install and Run the Driver

To install and start the driver on Linux, run the following command:

<DownloadURL os="linux" />

This will download, install, and start the Synnax standalone driver. Once the driver is
installed, we'll need to configure it to connect to your cluster.

## <StepText step="2" level="h2">Connect to a Cluster</StepText>

To connect to a cluster, you'll need to know the cluster's IP address, port, username,
and password. Then run the `synnax-driver login` command:

```bash
synnax-driver login
```

This will prompt you to enter the cluster's connection parameters. Once you've entered
the parameters, the driver will automatically connect to the cluster. Here's an example
of the output:

```
synnax-driver login
host (default: localhost): 10.0.0.45
port (default: 9090): 9090
username: synnax
password:
I20250318 04:57:06.681439 25261 login.cpp:47] connecting to Synnax at 10.0.0.45:9090
I20250318 04:57:06.792840 25261 login.cpp:53] successfully logged in!
I20250318 04:57:06.793918 25261 login.cpp:59] credentials saved successfully
```

## <StepText step="3" level="h2">Check the Driver Status</StepText>

As a final step, you can check the driver's status by running the `synnax-driver status`
command:

```bash
synnax-driver status
```

This will print the driver's status to the console. Here's an example of the output:

```
I20250318 05:07:04.312907  5935 daemon_nilinuxrt.cpp:490] Checking service status
I20250318 05:07:04.346398  5937 version.cpp:21] Synnax Driver v0.39.0 (2025-03-16 00:08:18)
Synnax Driver is running (PID: 28191)
```

## CLI Reference

### Start

The `start` command starts the driver as a background process on the host machine.

#### Example Usage

```bash
synnax-driver start
```

To start the driver as a foreground process, use the `--standalone` flag:

```bash
synnax-driver start --standalone
```

#### Flags

<Table
  columns={[
    { key: "option", name: "Flag", type: "code", width: 175 },
    { key: "default", name: "Default", type: "code" },
    { key: "description", name: "Description", type: "html" },
  ]}
  data={[
    {
      option: "--standalone/-s",
      default: "false",
      description: "Run the driver directly within the terminal process.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Stop

The `stop` command stops the driver.

#### Example Usage

```bash
synnax-driver stop
```

### Restart

The `restart` command restarts the driver. This is equivalent to stopping and then
starting the driver.

#### Example Usage

```bash
synnax-driver restart
```

### Login

The `login` command logs in to a Synnax cluster.

#### Example Usage

```bash
synnax-driver login
```

This will prompt you to enter the cluster's connection parameters. Once you've entered
the parameters, the driver will automatically connect to the cluster. Here's an example
of the output:

```
synnax-driver login
host (default: localhost): 10.0.0.45
port (default: 9090): 9090
username: synnax
password:
```

### Status

The `status` command prints the driver's status to the console.

#### Example Usage

```bash
synnax-driver status
```

### Uninstall

The `uninstall` command uninstalls the driver.

#### Example Usage

```bash
synnax-driver uninstall
```

### Logs

The `logs` command prints the driver's logs to the console.

#### Example Usage

```bash
synnax-driver logs
```

### Version

The `version` command prints the driver's version to the console.

#### Example Usage

```bash
synnax-driver version
```
