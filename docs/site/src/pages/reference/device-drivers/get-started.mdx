Synnax has developed a number of device drivers for a variety of vendors, including
[National Instruments](https://www.ni.com), [LabJack](https://labjack.com), and
[OPC UA](https://opcfoundation.org) servers. Synnax also supports building custom
drivers for devices that are not natively supported.

## Synnax Driver

The Synnax device driver natively supports reading and writing data from
[National Instruments](/reference/device-drivers/ni/get-started) hardware,
[OPC UA](/reference/device-drivers/opc-ua/connect-server) servers, and
[LabJack](/reference/device-drivers/labjack/get-started) devices.

### Embedded Driver

Every instance of the [Synnax Core](/reference/core/quick-start) comes with a built-in
device driver. This driver will run on the same machine as the Synnax Core, and starts
automatically when the Core starts. The embedded driver is recommended as the default
driver for must users.

### Standalone Driver

The [standalone driver](/reference/device-drivers/standalone) is a separate binary that
can run on a different machine from the Synnax Core. It is used to integrate data
acquisition devices across multiple machines. The standalone driver connects to a Synnax
cluster over the network.

#### Support for NI Linux Real-Time

The standalone driver supports deployment on
[NI Linux Real-Time](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/linux/introduction-to-ni-linux-real-time.html)
controllers, such as [NI CompactRIO](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/compactrio.html) and
[NI PXI](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/pxi.html) systems.

In addition to performing data acquisition and control tasks on real-time controllers,
the standalone driver also supports running
[embedded control sequences](/reference/control/embedded/get-started) on the real-time
controller, allowing for precisely timed control sequences that run close to the
hardware.

## Building a Custom Driver

If you don't see a driver for your hardware, you can build your own using the
[Python client](/reference/python-client/device-driver).
