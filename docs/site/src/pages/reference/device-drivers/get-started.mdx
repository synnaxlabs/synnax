Synnax has developed a number of device drivers for a variety of vendors, including
[National Instruments](https://www.ni.com), [LabJack](https://labjack.com),
[OPC UA](https://opcfoundation.org) servers, and Modbus TCP devices. Synnax also
supports building custom drivers for devices that are not natively supported.

## Synnax Driver

The Synnax Device Driver natively supports reading and writing data for
[National Instruments](/reference/device-drivers/ni/get-started),
[OPC UA](/reference/device-drivers/opc-ua/connect-server),
[Modbus TCP](/reference/device-drivers/modbus-tcp/connect-device), and
[LabJack](/reference/device-drivers/labjack/get-started) devices.

### Embedded Driver

Every instance of the [Synnax Core](/reference/cluster/quick-start) comes with the
Synnax Driver embedded inside. This driver will run on the same machine as the Synnax
server, and starts automatically when the server starts. The embedded driver is
recommended as the default driver for most users.

### Driver Installation

The [Synnax Driver](/reference/device-drivers/installation) can also be installed as a
separate binary that can run on a different machine from the Synnax server. It is used
to integrate data acquisition devices across multiple machines. The Driver connects to a
Synnax Core over the network.

#### Support for NI Linux Real-Time

The Driver supports deployment on
[NI Linux Real-Time](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/linux/introduction-to-ni-linux-real-time.html)
controllers, such as [NI CompactRIO](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/compactrio.html) and
[NI PXI](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/pxi.html) systems.

In addition to performing data acquisition and control tasks on real-time controllers,
the Driver also supports running
[embedded control sequences](/reference/control/embedded/get-started) on the real-time
controller, allowing for precisely timed control sequences that run close to the
hardware.

## Building a Custom Driver

If you don't see a driver for your hardware, you can build your own using the
[Python client](/reference/python-client/device-driver).
