Our built-in device drivers make it easy to work with hardware from a number of vendors
out of the box.

## Embedded vs. Standalone Driver

Synnax's device driver comes in two flavors. The first is a cluster-embedded driver.
This comes pre-installed with every [Synnax Cluster](/reference/cluster/get-started) and
allows you to integrate data acquisition devices that are running on the same machine
as the cluster. If you have no need to integrate data acquisition devices across
multiple machines, this is the driver for you, and there are no extra installation steps
required.

The second is our standalone driver. This is identical to the cluster-embedded driver,
but it is designed to run on a separate machine that communicates with the cluster over
the network.

### Support for NI Linux RT

The standalone driver supports deployment on [NI Linux Real-Time](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/linux/introduction-to-ni-linux-real-time.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqnEnJuKCO4hPSA1QO7Niru2xvnnnxrzzqRwnbWJz80CGNAGmLz)
controllers, such as [NI CompactRIO](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/compactrio.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqV135bYP1kLcU-pnf6NQCKsCFFCv0EHRj1Wjw0A8r48D9LbLHG)
and [NI PXI](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/pxi.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqsPrhSZSEL38oVdBsb-zBuN4U81ebnyIvws0wnWvyM_hL5Qefw)
systems.

In addition to performing data acquisition and control tasks on real-time controllers,
the standalone driver also supports running [embedded control
sequences](/reference/control/get-started) on the real-time controller, allowing for
precisely timed control sequences that run close to the hardware.

### Installing the Standalone Driver

To install the standalone driver, see the [standalone
driver](/reference/device-drivers/standalone-driver) page.

## Building a Custom Driver

If you don't see a driver for your hardware, you can build your own using the [Python
client](/reference/python-client/device-driver).
