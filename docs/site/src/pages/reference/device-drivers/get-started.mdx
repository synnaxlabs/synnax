Synnax has developed a number of device drivers for a variety of vendors, including
[National Instruments](https://www.ni.com), [LabJack](https://labjack.com), and [OPC
UA](https://opcfoundation.org) servers. Synnax also supports building custom drivers for
devices that are not natively supported.

## Synnax Driver

The Synnax device driver natively supports reading and writing data from[National
Instruments](/reference/device-drivers/ni/get-started) hardware, [OPC
UA](/reference/device-drivers/opc-ua/connect-server) servers, and
[LabJack](/reference/device-drivers/labjack/get-started) devices.

### Embedded Driver

Every instance of the [Synnax server](/reference/cluster/quick-start) comes with a
built-in device driver. This driver will run on the same machine as the Synnax server,
and starts automatically when the server starts. The embedded driver is recommended as
the default driver for must users,

### Standalone Driver

The [standalone driver](/reference/device-drivers/standalone) is a separate binary that
can run on a different machine from the Synnax server. It is used to integrate data
acquisition devices across multiple machines. The standalone driver connects to a Synnax
cluster over the network.

#### Support for NI Linux Real-Time

The standalone driver supports deployment on [NI Linux
Real-Time](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/linux/introduction-to-ni-linux-real-time.html)
controllers, such as [NI CompactRIO](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/compactrio.html) and [NI
PXI](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/pxi.html) systems.

In addition to performing data acquisition and control tasks on real-time controllers,
the standalone driver also supports running [embedded control
sequences](/reference/control/embedded/get-started) on the real-time controller,
allowing for precisely timed control sequences that run close to the hardware.

## Building a Custom Driver

If you don't see a driver for your hardware, you can build your own using the [Python
client](/reference/python-client/device-driver).
