The first step to acquiring data from your Modbus server is to establish a connection to
the server.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Prerequisites

Before you can connect to a Modbus server, you'll need to have the following configured:

1. A [Synnax Core](/reference/cluster/quick-start) running on your network.
2. The [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started) installed on your machine.
3. A Modbus server running on your network. This server must be reachable by the Core.

## <StepText level="h2" step={1}> Open the Connection Dialog </StepText>

We'll use the Console's configuration workflow to connect to your server. To kick things
off, open the Console and click on the search and command palette at the top. You can
also open this palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is `>`), type "Modbus".
You'll see an option called "Connect a Modbus Server". Select this option to open the
server configuration dialog.

## <StepText level="h2" step={2}> Configure the Connection </StepText>

The dialog will prompt you to enter the connection parameters to your server. Here's a
reference for each of the fields you'll need to fill:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>
        A name for your Modbus server. We'll use this to identify and manage the server
        in the Console.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Connect From</td>
      <td>The Synnax driver that will connect to the Modbus server.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Host</td>
      <td>
        The IP address or hostname of your Modbus server. This should be its reachable
        address on the network (e.g., `192.168.1.100` or `localhost`).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Port</td>
      <td>The TCP port for the Modbus server.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Swap Bytes</td>
      <td>
        Enable byte swapping for 16-bit values. This is used to handle different
        endianness between the server and Synnax. Only applicable for register types
        (holding registers and input registers).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Swap Words</td>
      <td>
        Enable word swapping for 32-bit and 64-bit values. This reorders 16-bit words
        within multi-register values to handle different word ordering conventions. Only
        applicable for 32-bit and 64-bit data types in registers.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## <StepText level="h2" step={3}> Save the Connection </StepText>

You can use the "Connect" button to verify that the server is reachable from the Core.
When you are ready to connect the server, click "Connect". The connection will be saved
and you can now create read and write tasks for this server.
