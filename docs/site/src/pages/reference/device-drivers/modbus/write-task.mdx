Write tasks are the primary method for sending control commands to a Modbus server from
Synnax.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the task, you'll need to have
[connected to a Modbus server](/reference/device-drivers/modbus/connect-server).

<Divider.Divider x />

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with devices in Synnax. Tasks can be used
for both control and data acquisition purposes. A Modbus Write Task defines a background
process that writes data to Holding Registers or Coils on the Modbus server based on values
written to Synnax [command channels](#how-commands-work-in-synnax).

A Modbus Write Task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. Synnax
permanently stores the configuration of the task, so it's easy to set up multiple
tasks for different purposes.

<Divider.Divider x />

## How Commands Work in Synnax

Commands in Synnax use command channels to signal a task to write values to the device.
For example, to set a Holding Register to a specific value, you would write that value
to the corresponding command channel.

A command channel for a Holding Register might be
`modbus_server_holding_register_100_cmd`, where `modbus_server` is the device
identifier, `holding_register` is the register type, `100` is the register address, and
`_cmd` indicates that it's a command channel.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Command channels also have an associated index channel that stores the timestamps at
  which commands were sent. This channel is suffixed with `_cmd_time`. For the command
  channel `modbus_server_holding_register_100_cmd`, the index channel would be
  `modbus_server_holding_register_100_cmd_time`.
</Note.Note>

Write tasks process commands from these command channels and send the appropriate Modbus
write requests to the device. The task continuously monitors command channels and writes
new values as they are received.

## Open the Task Configuration Dialog

To create a write task from the command palette, open the Synnax Console and click on
the Search and Command Palette at the top. You can also open this palette with
`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type "Modbus".
You'll see an option called "Create a Modbus Write Task". Select this option to open the
write task configuration dialog.

## Task Configuration Parameters

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>A name for your write task.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Modbus Device</td>
      <td>Which Modbus server the task will write to.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Saving</td>
      {
        <td>
          Data saving defines whether command data will be permanently stored in Synnax.
          When enabled, Synnax will store a record of all commands sent. When disabled,
          only the most recent command will be kept in memory.

## Writable Register Types

For write tasks, you can write to two types of Modbus registers:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Register Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Data Width</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Coil Output</td>
      <td>
        Write to discrete output Coils. Used for binary control signals like turning
        devices on/off.
      </td>
      <td>1 bit (boolean)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Holding Register Output</td>
      <td>
        Write to analog output registers. Used for control values like setpoints,
        speeds, or positions.
      </td>
      <td>16 bits (configurable data type)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Input Registers and Discrete Inputs are read-only register types and cannot be used in
  write tasks. To read from these registers, use a [read
  task](/reference/device-drivers/modbus/read-task).
</Note.Note>

<Divider.Divider x />

## Data Types for Holding Registers

For Holding Register outputs, you can specify the data type for each channel. Synnax
supports the following data types:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Data Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Size</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`int16`</td>
      <td>16-bit signed integer</td>
      <td>1 register (2 bytes)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`uint16`</td>
      <td>16-bit unsigned integer</td>
      <td>1 register (2 bytes)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`int32`</td>
      <td>32-bit signed integer</td>
      <td>2 registers (4 bytes)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`uint32`</td>
      <td>32-bit unsigned integer</td>
      <td>2 registers (4 bytes)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`float32`</td>
      <td>32-bit IEEE 754 floating point</td>
      <td>2 registers (4 bytes)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

Coil Outputs are always boolean values and do not require a data type specification.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  For multi-register data types (`int32`, `uint32`, `float32`), make sure the byte and word
  ordering matches your server's configuration. Use the "Swap Bytes" and "Swap Words"
  settings in the device connection configuration if needed.
</Note.Note>

## Adding Channels to a Task

To add a channel to a task, click the "Add Channel" button in the task configuration
dialog. For each channel, you'll need to specify:

1. **Register Type** - Select from Coil Output or Holding Register Output
2. **Address** - The Modbus register address (e.g., 0, 100, 40001)
3. **Data Type** - For Holding Registers, select the data type (`int16`, `uint16`, `int32`,
   `uint32`, `float32`)
4. **Channel Name** - A descriptive name for the command channel

You can enable or disable individual channels using the toggle button to the right of
each channel. This is useful for temporarily stopping command processing for specific
channels without removing them from the task.

## Configuring the Task

Once you've added all your channels and configured the task parameters, click the
"Configure" button to save the task configuration. This will create Synnax command
channels for each of your Modbus outputs and prepare the task for execution.

Note that configuring a write task will only create
[command channels](#how-commands-work-in-synnax). The task will process commands from
these channels and write the values to the Modbus server.

After configuration, you can start and stop the task at any time. The task configuration
is permanently stored, so you can easily resume command processing later.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Stopping and Starting Tasks

To stop and start a task, you can open up the task toolbar on the left-hand side and
click play and pause. You can also click the play/pause icon in the bottom of the task
configuration window.

## Using a Schematic to Control Write Tasks

Once the write task is configured and running, you can use a
[schematic](/reference/console/schematics) to send commands to the Modbus server. Simply
connect schematic controls (like buttons, sliders, or valves) to the command channels
created by your write task.

For example, to control a valve connected to a Coil Output, you would set the valve's
`command` field to the command channel of the Coil Output. Clicking the valve in the
schematic would send a command to toggle the Coil state.
