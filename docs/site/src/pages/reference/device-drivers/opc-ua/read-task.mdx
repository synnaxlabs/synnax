Read tasks are the primary method for acquiring data from a PLC and storing it
in Synnax. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up a
read task.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the task, you'll need to have connected to an OPC UA server
and created the relevant channels in Synnax. Check out [Connect to an OPC UA
Server](/reference/device-drivers/opcua/connect-server) for information on how
to do this.

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with devices in Synnax. Tasks can
be used for both control and data acquisition purposes. In the context of OPC
UA, a read task defines a background process that reads data from your server at
a specified sampling rate.

An OPC UA read task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. We
permanently store the configuration of the task in Synnax, so it's easy to set
up multiple tasks for different purposes.

## Important Rules for Read Tasks

There are a few important concepts to keep in mind when configuring a read task.

### Sample Rates & Timing

All channels in a read task are sampled at the same rate. If you'd like to
sample different channels at different rates, create a separate task to do so. 

Synnax uses software timing to read from your PLC, and typically delivers
precision on the order of 100 microseconds. Under heavy load, this timing
precision may degrade.

For low rate, sub 200 Hz tasks where timing is not critical, we recommend
letting Synnax automatically determine the timestamps for index channels (for
more information, see [correctly configuring
indexes](/reference/device-drivers/opcua/connect-server#correctly-configure-indexes)).

For high-precision tasks, we recommend [reading timestamps from the
PLC](/reference/device-drivers/opcua/read-task#optional---read-timestamps-from-the-plc).

For high rate tasks above 500 Hz, we also recommend sampling in [array
mode](/reference/device-drivers/opcua/read-task#configuring-the-task---array-sampling),
where Synnax will read samples in bulk from the PLC. Array mode is more
challenging to configure, but can be far more efficient.

### One Running Task Per Channel

Synnax can only accept live data from a channel from one source at a time. If
you have a task running that reads from a `pressure` channel, you cannot create
another task that reads from the same channel.

### One Running Task per Index Channel

[Index channels](/reference/concepts/channels#channel-types) are use to store
the timestamps for your data channels. When you configure a task to read from a
data channel, Synnax will automatically generate timestamps for the
corresponding index channel, regardless of whether you've explicitly added it to
the task.

For example, imaging we two channels, `pressure` and `temperature` that share
the same index channel, `time`. If you configure a task to read from `pressure`,
Synnax will automatically generate timestamps for the `time` channel. If you
then configure a task to read from `temperature`, Synnax will not allow you to
start the task, as the `time` channel is already in use.

## Open the Task Configuration Dialog

To configure a read task, open the Synnax Console and click on the Quick Search
& Command Palette at the top. You can also open this palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P`
on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type
"OPC UA". You'll see an option called "Create a New Read Task". Select this
option to open the read task configuration dialog.

## Configuring the Task - Default Sampling

The default sampling mode reads a single sample from the server for each channel
in the task at the specified sampling rate. This is the simplest mode to
configure, and is ideal for most applications that don't require high data
rates. For high data rates, see [Array
Sampling](/reference/device-drivers/opcua/read-task#configuring-the-task---array-sampling).

### <StepText level="h3" step={1}> Select your OPC UA Device</StepText>

The first step is to select the OPC UA server you'd like to collect data from.
Use the dropdown menu in the top left corner to do so.

### <StepText level="h3" step={2}>Add Channels to the Task</StepText>

Next, you'll need to add channels to the task. These channels define a mapping
between the OPC UA node you'd like to read from, and the corresponding Synnax
channel you'd like to store the data in.

To add a channel, click on the "+" button in the channels section. Then, click
on the new channel and select the OPC UA node you'd like to read from. Finally,
select the Synnax channel you'd like to store the data in. Note that the Synnax
channel doesn't need to be the same as the channel you created when configuring
the server.

id="device-drivers/opcua/read-task/default-timing-add-channels" />

### <StepText level="h3" step={3}>Optional - Read Timestamps from the PLC</StepText>

If the index channel(s) for your corresponding data channels is not in the task,
Synnax will automatically generate timestamps when reading data from the server.
This is fine if you're not concerned about timing precision. 

If you'd like to pull timestamps from the PLC, simply add the index channel to
the task and select the corresponding OPC UA node.

### <StepText level="h3" step={4}>Configure Timing</StepText>

There are two parameters to control the timing of the task: the sample rate and
the stream rate. The sample rate defines how often Synnax will poll the OPC UA
server for new data, while the stream rate defines how often the task will
stream data into Synnax.

For example, if you set the sample rate to 10 Hz and the stream rate to 1 Hz.
Synnax will poll the OPC UA server every 100 ms, collect 10 samples, and then
forward these samples to the server. 

For very low rate tasks (&lt;50Hz), we recommend setting the stream rate to the
same value as the sample rate. For higher rate tasks, lowering the stream rate
can significantly improve performance. It's typically best to keep the stream
rate below 50Hz unless you need to quickly process incoming data in real-time.

### <StepText level="h3" step={5}>Enable/Disable Data Saving</StepText>

Data saving defines whether acquired data will be permanently stored in Synnax. When
enabled, Synnax will both stream and store data. When disabled, Synnax will only
stream data for real-time visualization. Historical data will not be available for review.

### <StepText level="h3" step={6}>Configure and Start the Task</StepText>

Once you'd added all the channels you need, click the "Configure" button. If
there are no errors, Synnax will acknowledge the configured task and enable the
"Play" button in the dialog.

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/opcua/read-task/start-task" />   

At this point, feel free to close the dialog. Your task will continue to run in
the background until you re-open the window to stop it.

## Configuring the Task - Array Sampling

Array sampling is a more advanced method of reading data from an OPC UA server,
and is typically only necessary for very high rate tasks (&gt;500 Hz). Instead
of reading single samples from the server, Synnax will read many samples in
bulk. Array sampling requires a little bit of tuning to set up, and here's how
you can do it.

<Note variant="info">
When experimenting with array based sampling, we recommend
running a [separate](/reference/cluster/quick-start?platform=linux) Synnax
database with a memory-backed data store. This will allow you to quickly test
different configurations without writing a large amount of experimental data to
your production database.
</Note>

### <StepText level="h3" step={1}>Make sure your PLC is correctly configured</StepText>

Make sure your PLC is correctly configured to read data in arrays. For
information on how to do this, see [considerations for high data
rates](device-drivers/opcua/connect-server#considerations-for-high-data-rates).

### <StepText level="h3" step={2}>Enable Array Sampling</StepText>

To enable array sampling mode for a task, toggle the "Array Sampling" switch in
the top left corner. This will alter the "Stream Rate" field to display an
"Array Size" field instead.

**Set the array size to the same length as the arrays you'll be reading from the
PLC.** 

### <StepText level="h3" step={3}>Add Channels to the Task</StepText>

In array mode, you'll only be able to add PLC nodes that are array-based.
Otherwise, the process is the same as for default sampling.

### <StepText level="h3" step={4}>Configure Index Channels</StepText>

For high data rates, we recommend reading timestamps from the PLC instead of
having Synnax generate them. To do this, add the index channel for any of your
data channels to the task, and select the corresponding PLC node that contains
the timestamps.

### <StepText level="h3" step={5}>Timing</StepText>

Running a task with array sampling enabled can result in both **oversampling**
and **undersampling**. Oversampling occurs when the PLC doesn't completely
replace all values in the array before Synnax reads it. Undersampling can occur
when the PLC is re-writing the array faster than Synnax can read it. 

We recommend setting the sampling rate to the **same** sampling rate as the PLC.
Naturally, we recommend that this rate is an even multiple of the array size.
For very high data rates, under and oversampling by a few samples in the array
can occur under normal operating conditions. This typically isn't a problem. If
you're concerned about this, [let us know](https://www.synnaxlabs.com/contact).

As an example, here's a configuration for a task that reads at 8460 Hz from an
array of length 320. This means that the task will reads 320 samples and forward
them to Synnax 27 times per second.

### <StepText level="h3" step={6}>Configure and Start the Task</StepText>

Once you've added all the channels you need, click the "Configure" button. If
there are no errors, Synnax will acknowledge the configured task and enable the
"Play" button in the dialog.
