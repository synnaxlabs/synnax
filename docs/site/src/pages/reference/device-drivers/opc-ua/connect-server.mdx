The first step to acquiring data from your PLC is to connect to an OPC UA server.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Prerequisites

Before you can connect to an OPC UA server, you'll need to have the following
configured:

1. A [Synnax cluster](/reference/core/quick-start) running on your network.
2. The [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started) installed on your machine.
3. An OPC UA compliant server running on your network. This OPC UA server must be
   reachable by the Synnax cluster.

## <StepText level="h2" step={1}> Open the Connection Dialog </StepText>

We'll use the console's configuration workflow to connect to your server. To kick things
off, open the console and click on the search and command palette at the top. You can
also open this palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type "OPC UA".
You'll see an option called "Connect an OPC UA Server". Select this open to open the
server configuration dialog.

## <StepText level="h2" step={2}> Configure the Connection </StepText>

The dialog will prompt you to enter the connection parameters to your server. Here's a
reference for each of the fields you'll need to fill:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>
        A name for your server. We'll use this to identify and manage the server in the
        console.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Connect From</td>
      <td>
        The Synnax driver that will connect to the OPC UA server.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Endpoint</td>
      <td>
        The endpoint URL for your server. This should be it's reachable address on the
        network, and typically begins with `opc.tcp://`.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Username</td>
      <td>
        The username to use when connecting to the server. This is optional and can be
        left blank.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Password</td>
      <td>
        The password to use when connecting to the server. This is optional and can be
        left blank.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Security Mode</td>
      <td>
        The security mode to use when connecting to the server. This should match the
        security mode configured on the server:

        - **None**: No security is applied.
        - **Sign**: Messages are signed but not encrypted. Requires authentication but
                    does not guarantee confidentiality.
        - **SignAndEncrypt**: Messages are signed and encrypted, ensuring authenticity
                              and confidentiality.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Security Policy</td>
      <td>
        The security policy to use when connecting to the server. This should match the
        security policy configured on the server:

        - **None**: No security is applied.
        - **Basic128Rsa15**: Basic 128-bit encryption using RSA-15.
        - **Basic256**: Basic 256-bit encryption.
        - **Basic256Sha256**: Basic 256-bit encryption with SHA-256.
        - **Aes128Sha256RsaOaep**: 128-bit AES encryption with SHA-256 and RSA OAEP.
        - **Aes256Sha256RsaPss**: 256-bit AES encryption with SHA-256 and RSA PSS.

## <StepText level="h2" step={3}> Save the Connection </StepText>

You can use the "Test Connection" button to verify that the server is connected to the
Synnax cluster. When you are ready to connect the server, click "Save".
