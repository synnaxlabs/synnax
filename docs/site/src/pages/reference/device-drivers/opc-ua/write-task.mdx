Write tasks are the primary method for acquiring data from an OPC UA server and starting
it in Synnax.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the task, you'll need to have
[connected to an OPC UA server](/reference/device-drivers/opc-ua/connect-server).

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with devices in Synnax. Tasks can be used
for both control and data acquisition purposes. An OPC UA write task defines a
background process that writes data to nodes on the OPC UA server based on values
written to Synnax [command channels](#how-commands-work-in-synnax).

An OPC UA write task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. We
permanently store the configuration of the task in Synnax, so it's easy to set up
multiple tasks for different purposes.

## How Commands Work in Synnax

Commands in Synnax require two types of channels: a command channel and state channel.
Command channels signal a task to set the value of a digital output. To set a digital
output to high, you would write a `1` to the command channel. To set it to low, you
would write a `0`.

A command channel for a digital output might be `my_temp_card_do_0_1_cmd`, where
`my_temp_card` is the device identifier, `do_0_1` is the port and line of the digital
output, and `_cmd` indicates that it's a command channel.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Command channels also have an associated index channel that stores the timestamps at
  which commands were sent. This channel is suffixed with `_cmd_time`. For the command
  channel `my_temp_card_do_0_1_cmd`, the index channel would be
  `my_temp_card_do_0_1_cmd_time`.
</Note.Note>

State channels represent the current state of the digital output. When you send a
command, the corresponding digital write task will process the command and update the
value in the state channel.

State channels are typically suffixed with `_state`. A state channel maintains the same
format as its corresponding command channel, but suffixed with `_state` instead of
`_cmd`.

As an example, to configure a valve in a [schematic](/reference/console/schematics) to
write to a digital output, you would set the `command` field to the command channel of
the digital output and the `state` field to the state channel of the digital output.
Clicking the valve would send a command to the digital output, and the valve would turn
solid or transparent based on the state channel.

Using two channels provides a guarantee that a particular command was acknowledged by a
running task.

## Open the Task Configuration Dialog

There are several ways to create OPC UA write tasks in the Synnax Console.

### From the Resources Toolbar

To create a write task from the resources toolbar, open the Synnax Console and click on
the resources (<Icon.Resources />) toolbar in the left sidebar. Find the device you'd
like to create the task for, right-click on it, and select "Create a Write Task".

  id="device-drivers/opc-ua/write-task/create-from-resources"
/>

### From the Command Palette

To create a write task from the command palette, open the Synnax Console and click on
the Quick Search & Command Palette at the top. You can also open this palette with
`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type "OPC UA".
You'll see an option called "Create a New Write Task". Select this option to open the
write task configuration dialog.

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/opc-ua/write-task/create-from-palette" />

### From The Layout Selector

To create a write task from the layout selector, click on the "+" button in the top
right corner and select "OPC write Task".

      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>A name for your read task.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>OPC UA Server</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Saving</td>
      {
        <td>
          Data saving defines whether acquired data will be permanently stored in
          Synnax. When enabled, Synnax will both stream and store data. When disabled,
          Synnax will only stream data for real-time visualization. Historical data will
          not be available for review.

## Adding Channels to a Task

To add a channel to a task, simply find the desired channel in the browser and drag it
over to the channels window. From here, you can change the name of the channel. If you
would like to stop a channel from being read, you can click the disable/enable button to
the right of the channel.

To configure the task, just click the "Configure" button. This will save the task
configuration, and you will be able to pause and resume the tasks whenever you want.
Note that configuring a write task here will only create
[command channels](#how-commands-work-in-synnax). In order to create state channels, you
must configure a [read task](/reference/device-drivers/opc-ua/read-task).

## Stopping and Starting Tasks

To stop and start a task, you can open up the task toolbar on the left-hand side and
click play and pause. You can also click the play/pause icon in the bottom of the task
configuration window.

## State Configuration

Configuring a write task will only create command channels. To create state channels to
access the states of the nodes you are writing to, you must configure a
[read task](/reference/device-drivers/opc-ua/read-task). You can then use the read task
to read back states of the nodes you are writing to.

## Using a Schematic to Control Write Tasks

Once the necessary tasks are configured, you can use a
[schematic](/reference/console/schematics) to write commands to the OPC UA server.
