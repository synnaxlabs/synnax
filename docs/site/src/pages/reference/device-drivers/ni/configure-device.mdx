The first step to start acquiring data and sending commands to your National Instruments
(NI) hardware is to connect and configure your module.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using your NI hardware with Synnax, you will need to ensure that
you have the following:

1. A Synnax [deployment](/reference/cluster/quick-start) running on your network. This
   deployment must be running on a Windows machine that your NI hardware is connected
   to.
2. The NI
   [DAQmx](https://www.ni.com/en/support/documentation/supplemental/06/getting-started-with-ni-daqmx--main-page.html)
   drivers installed on the machine running the Synnax deployment. Installation
   instructions can be found
   [here](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#532710).
3. The [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started) installed on your local machine.

## <StepText level="h2" step={1}>Select a Device to Configure</StepText>

Synnax will automatically detect new NI modules, and display a notification in the
Console when a new device is connected. To start configuring the device, find the device
in the resources toolbar, right click on the device and select "Configure".

## <StepText level="h2" step={2}>Name Your Device</StepText>

The first step in the configuration dialog will prompt you to name your device. This
name will be used for your team to identify the device in the console.

## <StepText level="h2" step={3}>Set the Device Identifier</StepText>

Next, you'll need to set a short device identifier. This identifier will be used to
prefix the names of all of the channels on your device. We've automatically generated a
few suggestions, although you're welcome to choose your own. We recommend keeping this
as short as possible, while still uniquely identifying the device.

## <StepText level="h2" step={4}>Save the Configuration</StepText>

Once you're happy with the name and identifier, the last step is to save the
configuration by hitting the blue "Save" button in the bottom right corner.
