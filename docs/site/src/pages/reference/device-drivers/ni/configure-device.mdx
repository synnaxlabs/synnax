The first step to start acquiring data and sending commands to your National Instruments
(NI) hardware is to connect and configure your module.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using your NI hardware with Synnax, you will need to ensure that
you have the following:

1. A [Synnax Core](/reference/core/quick-start) running on your network.
2. A [Synnax Driver](/reference/device-driver/get-started) running on your network. This
   Driver must be connected to the Core and running on the same machine as your NI
   hardware is connected to.
3. The
   [NI-DAQmx](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html)
   and
   [System Configuration](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.system-configuration.html)
   drivers installed on the machine running the Synnax Driver.
4. The [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started) installed on your local machine.

## <StepText level="h2" step={1}>Select a Device to Configure</StepText>

Synnax will automatically detect new NI modules, and display a notification in the
Console when a new device is connected. To start configuring the device, find the device
in the Devices Toolbar, right click on the device and select "Configure".

## <StepText level="h2" step={2}>Name Your Device</StepText>

The first step in the configuration dialog will prompt you to name your device. This
name will be used to identify the device in Synnax.

## <StepText level="h2" step={3}>Set the Device Identifier</StepText>

Next, you'll need to set a short device identifier. This identifier will be used to
prefix the names of all of the channels on your device. We've automatically generated a
few suggestions, although you're welcome to choose your own. We recommend keeping this
as short as possible, while still uniquely identifying the device.

## <StepText level="h2" step={4}>Save the Configuration</StepText>

Once you're happy with the name and identifier, the last step is to save the
configuration by hitting the blue "Save" button in the bottom-right corner.
