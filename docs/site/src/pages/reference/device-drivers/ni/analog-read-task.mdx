The analog read task is used for acquiring data from analog inputs on your NI devices.
In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps for creating an analog read task using
the Synnax Console.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the task, you'll need to have connected and configured an NI device
and created the relevant channels in Synnax. Check out the
[Configure Device](/reference/device-drivers/ni/configure-device) guide for more
information.

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with hardware devices in Synnax. Tasks
can be used for both control and data acquisition purposes. In the context of the NI
Driver, an analog read task defines a background process that reads data from the analog
inputs on a particular DAQ card.

An analog read task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. We
permanently store the configuration of the task in Synnax, so it's easy to set up
multiple tasks for different purposes.

## Important Rules for Analog Read Tasks

There are a few important rules to keep in mind when creating an analog read task.

### Sample Rates

All channels in the task are sampled at the same rate. If you'd like to sample different
channels at different rates, create a separate task to do so.

### One Running Task Per Port

Synnax can only read live data into a channel from one source at a time. If you have two
tasks that read from "ai0" on the same device, you cannot have both tasks running at the
same time.

## Open the Task Configuration Dialog

### From the Resources Toolbar

To create an analog read task from the resources toolbar, open the Synnax Console and
click on the resources (<Icon.Resources />) tab in the left sidebar. Find the device
you'd like to create the task for, right-click on it, and select "Create Analog Read
Task".

### From the Command Palette

To create an analog read task from the command palette, open the Synnax Console and
click on the Quick Search & Command Palette at the top. You can also open this palette
with `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type "NI".
You'll see an option called "Create a New Analog Read Task". Select this option to open
the read task configuration dialog.

### From The Layout Selector

To create an analog read task from the layout selector, click on the "+" button in the
top right corner of the central mosaic and select "NI Analog Read Task".

## Configuring the Task

### <StepText level="h3" step={1}>Select your NI Device</StepText>

The first step is to select the NI device you'd like to read data from. Use the dropdown
menu in the top left corner to do so.

  id="device-drivers/ni/analog-read-task/analog-read-task-select-device"
/>

### <StepText level="h3" step={2}>Add Channels to the Task</StepText>

Next, you'll need to add channels to read data from. Click on the "+" button in the
channels section. Then, click on the new channel in the list to configure it.

### <StepText level="h3" step={3}>Configure Timing</StepText>

There are two parameters to control the timing of the task: the **sample rate** and the
**stream rate**. The sample rate defines how many samples per second the task will read
from the device. The stream rate defines how often the task will stream data into
Synnax.

For example, if you set the sample rate to 10 Hz and the stream rate to 1 Hz, Synnax
will read a batch of 10 samples every second, and then forward the entire batch to the
Synnax database.

For very low rate tasks (&lt; 50Hz), we recommend setting the stream rate to the same
value as the sample rate. For higher rate tasks, lowering the stream rate can
significantly improve performance. It's typically best to keep the stream rate below
50Hz unless you need to quickly process incoming data in real-time.

    id="device-drivers/ni/analog-read-task/analog-read-task-timing"
    style={{ width: "50%", minWidth: 200 }}
  />
</div>

### <StepText level="h3" step={4}>Enable/Disable Data Saving</StepText>

Data saving defines whether acquired data will be permanently stored in Synnax. When
enabled, Synnax will both stream and store data. When disabled, Synnax will only stream
data for real-time visualization, control, and processing. Historical data will not be
available for review.

We recommend turning data saving off when you're testing a new task or running
operations where historical data saving is not important.

## Start the Task

Once you'd added all of the channels you need and have configured task
PerformanceTiming, hit the "Configure" button. If there are no errors, Synnax will
acknowledge the configured task and enable the Play (<Icon.Play />) button in the
dialog. Click this button to start the task.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Starting and stopping a task does not re-apply the task configuration. If you've made
  changes to the configuration, you'll need to re-configure the task by hitting the
  "Configure" button.
