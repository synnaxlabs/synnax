The NI Analog Read Task is used for acquiring data from analog inputs on your NI
devices. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps for creating an analog read
task using the Synnax Console.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the task, you'll need to have
[connected and configured an NI device](/reference/device-drivers/ni/configure-device).

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with hardware devices in Synnax. Tasks
can be used for both control and data acquisition purposes. In the context of the NI
Driver, an analog read task defines a background process that reads data from the analog
inputs on a particular DAQ card.

An analog read task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. Synnax
permanently stores the configuration of the task, so it's easy to set up multiple tasks
for different purposes.

## Important Rules for Analog Read Tasks

There are a few important rules to keep in mind when creating an analog read task.

### Sample Rates

All channels in the task are sampled at the same rate. If you'd like to sample different
channels at different rates, create a separate task to do so.

### One Running Task Per Port

Synnax can only read live data into a channel from one source at a time. If you have two
tasks that read from "ai0" on the same device, you cannot have both tasks running at the
same time.

## Open the Task Configuration Dialog

### From the Devices Toolbar

To create an analog read task from the Devices Toolbar, open the Console and click on
the device icon (<Icon.Device />) on the left-hand side of the screen. Find the device
you'd like to create the task for, right-click on it, and select "Create analog read
task".

### From the Command Palette

To create an analog read task from the command palette, open the Console and click on
the Search and Command Palette at the top. You can also open this palette with
`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type "NI".
You'll see an option called "Create an NI Analog Read Task". Select this option to open
the analog read task configuration dialog.

### From The Layout Selector

To create an analog read task from the layout selector, click on the add icon (<Icon.Add
/>) in the top-right corner of the central mosaic and select "NI Analog Read Task".

## Configuring the Task

### <StepText level="h3" step={1}>Select your NI Device</StepText>

The first step is to select the NI device you'd like to read data from. Use the dropdown
menu in the top-left corner to do so.

/>

### <StepText level="h3" step={2}>Add Channels to the Task</StepText>

Next, you'll need to add channels to read data from. Click on the add icon (<Icon.Add
/>) in the channels section. Then, click on the new channel in the list to configure it.

### <StepText level="h3" step={3}>Configure Timing</StepText>

There are two parameters to control the timing of the task: the **sample rate** and the
**stream rate**. The sample rate defines how many samples per second the task will read
from the device. The stream rate defines how often the task will stream data into
Synnax.

For example, if you set the sample rate to 10 Hz and the stream rate to 1 Hz, Synnax
will read a batch of 10 samples every second, and then forward the entire batch to the
Synnax database.

For very low rate tasks (&lt; 50 Hz), we recommend setting the stream rate to the same
value as the sample rate. For higher rate tasks, lowering the stream rate can
significantly improve performance. It's typically best to keep the stream rate below 50
Hz unless you need to quickly process incoming data in real-time.

    style={{ width: "50%", minWidth: 200 }}
  />
</div>

### <StepText level="h3" step={4}>Enable/Disable Data Saving</StepText>

Data saving defines whether acquired data will be permanently stored in Synnax. When
enabled, Synnax will both stream and store data. When disabled, Synnax will only stream
data for real-time visualization, control, and processing. Historical data will not be
available for review.

We recommend turning data saving off when you're testing a new task or running
operations where historical data saving is not important.

## Start the Task

Once you'd added all of the channels you need and have configured task timing, hit the
"Configure" button. If there are no errors, Synnax will acknowledge the configured task
and enable the Play (<Icon.Play />) button in the dialog. Click this button to start the
task.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Starting and stopping a task does not re-apply the task configuration. If you've made
  changes to the configuration, you'll need to re-configure the task by hitting the
  "Configure" button.
