The Synnax Driver supports reading and writing data from
[National Instruments (NI)](https://www.ni.com/en-us.html) hardware, including
CompactDAQ, CompactRIO, and PXI systems. This page will walk you through the steps to
start acquiring data from your NI devices using the Driver.

## Supported Devices

**Synnax supports reading and writing data to all National Instruments devices that are
supported by the
[NI-DAQmx driver](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daqmx.html).**

Aside from very old DAQ modules, Synnax is generally compatible with every NI device.

## Installation

Every instance of the [Synnax Core](/reference/core/quick-start) comes with the Synnax
Driver embedded inside, so there are no additional installation steps unless you're
using the Real-Time Linux Driver for CompactRIO.

### Real-Time Linux Driver for CompactRIO

The Synnax Driver can also be installed as a
[separate binary](/reference/device-drivers/installation?platform=ni-linux-rt) to run
data acquisition and control tasks on NI controllers that support NI Linux Real-Time.

## OS Compatibility

The Synnax Driver is compatible with Linux, Windows, and NI Linux Real-Time. The Driver
will not be able to find your devices when running on macOS or within a containerized
environment (even if the container is running on a supported OS).

### Installing NI-DAQmx and System Configuration Libraries

National Instruments'
[NI-DAQmx](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html) and
[System Configuration](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.system-configuration.html)
drivers must be installed for Synnax to communicate with your hardware.

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  If you have a Synnax Driver already running before installing NI-DAQmx, you'll need to
  restart the Driver for it to recognize the NI-DAQmx installation.
