The Synnax Driver supports reading and writing data from
[National Instruments (NI)](https://www.ni.com/en-us.html) hardware, including
CompactDAQ, CompactRIO, and PXI systems. This page will walk you through the steps to
start acquiring data from your NI devices using the Driver.

## Supported Devices

**Synnax supports reading and writing data to all National Instruments devices that are
supported by the
[NI-DAQmx driver](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daqmx.html).**

Aside from very old DAQ modules, Synnax is generally compatible with every NI device.

## Installation

Every instance of the [Synnax Core](/reference/core/quick-start) comes with the Synnax
Driver embedded inside, so there are no additional installation steps unless you're
using the Real-Time Linux Driver for CompactRIO.

### Real-Time Linux Driver for CompactRIO

The Synnax Driver can also be installed as a separate binary to run data acquisition and
control tasks on NI controllers that support NI Linux RT. For installation instructions,
see the [Driver installation](/reference/device-drivers/installation) page.

## OS Compatibility

The Synnax Driver is compatible with Linux, Windows, and NI Linux RT. The Driver will
not be able to find your devices when running on macOS or within a containerized
environment (even if the container is running on a supported OS).

### Installing DAQmx and System Configuration Libraries

National Instruments' DAQmx and System Configuration drivers must be installed for
Synnax to communicate with your hardware. Instructions for installing DAQmx can be found
on the
[National Instruments website.](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#532710)
Instructions for installing System Configuration can be found on the
[following page.](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.system-configuration.html)

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  If you have a Synnax Driver already running before installing DAQmx, you'll need to
  restart the Driver for Synnax to recognize the DAQmx installation.
