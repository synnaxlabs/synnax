The [National Instruments (NI)](https://www.ni.com/en-us.html) device driver allows
Synnax to directly connect to your NI hardware, including CompactDAQ, CompactRIO, and
PXI systems. This page will walk you through some of the important pre-requisites
necessary to get started with the NI driver.

## Supported Devices

**Synnax supports reading and writing data to all National Instruments devices that are supported by the [NI-DAQmx driver](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daqmx.html).**

Aside from very old DAQ modules, Synnax is generally compatible with every NI device.

## Installation

The NI Driver comes pre-installed with every Synnax Cluster, so there are no additional
installation steps unless you're using the Real-Time Linux Driver for CompactRIO.

### Real-Time Linux Driver for CompactRIO

We also have a standalone driver that can be used to run data acquisition and control
tasks on NI controllers that support NI Linux RT. For installation instructions, see
the [standalone driver](/reference/device-drivers/standalone) page.

## OS Compatibility

The NI driver is compatible with Linux, Windows, and NI Linux RT. The driver will not be
able to find your devices when running on macOS or within a containerized environment
(even if the container is running on a supported OS).

### Installing DAQmx and System Configuration Libraries

National Instruments' DAQmx and System Configuration drivers must be installed for Synnax to communicate with your
hardware. Instructions for installing DAQmx can be found on the
[National Instruments website.](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#532710)
Instructions for installing System Configuration can be found on the [following page.](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.system-configuration.html)

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  If you have a Synnax cluster already running before installing DAQmx, you'll need to
  restart the cluster for Synnax to recognize the DAQmx installation.
