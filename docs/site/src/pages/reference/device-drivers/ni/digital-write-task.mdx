The Digital Write Task is used for sending commands to the digital outputs of your NI
cards. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create a Digital Write Task in
Synnax.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the task, you'll need to have connected and configured an NI device
and created the relevant channels in Synnax. Check out the
[Configure Device](/reference/device-drivers/ni/configure-device) guide for more
information.

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with hardware devices in Synnax. Tasks
can be used for both control and data acquisition purposes. In the context of the NI
Driver, a digital write task defines a background process that writes to the digital
outputs of your device based on values written to Synnax
[command channels](#how-commands-work-in-synnax).

A digital write task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. We
permanently store the configuration of the task in Synnax, so it's easy to set up
multiple tasks for different purposes.

## How Commands Work in Synnax

Commands in Synnax require two types of channels: a command channel and state channel.
Command channels signal a task to set the value of a digital output. To set a digital
output to high, you would write a `1` to the command channel. To set it to low, you
would write a `0`.

A command channel for a digital output might be `my_temp_card_do_0_1_cmd`, where
`my_temp_card` is the device identifier, `do_0_1` is the port and line of the digital
output, and `_cmd` indicates that it's a command channel.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Command channels also have an associated index channel that stores the timestamps at
  which commands were sent. This channel is suffixed with `_cmd_time`. For the command
  channel `my_temp_card_do_0_1_cmd`, the index channel would be
  `my_temp_card_do_0_1_cmd_time`.
</Note.Note>

State channels represent the current state of the digital output. When you send a
command, the corresponding digital write task will process the command and update the
value in the state channel.

State channels are typically suffixed with `_state`. A state channel maintains the same
format as its corresponding command channel, but suffixed with `_state` instead of
`_cmd`.

As an example, to configure a valve in the [schematic](/reference/console/schematics) to
write to a digital output, you would set the `command` field to the command channel of
the digital output and the `state` field to the state channel of the digital output.
Clicking the valve would send a command to the digital output, and the valve would turn
solid or transparent based on the state channel.

Using two channels provides a guarantee that a particular command was acknowledged by a
running task.

## Open the Task Configuration Dialog

### From the Resources Toolbar

To create a digital write task from the resources toolbar, open the Synnax Console and
click on the resources (<Icon.Resources />) toolbar in the left sidebar. Find the device
you'd like to create the task for, right-click on it, and select "Create Digital write
Task".

### From the Command Palette

To create a digital write task from the command palette, open the Synnax Console and
click on the Quick Search & Command Palette at the top. You can also open this palette
with `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type "NI".
You'll see an option called "Create a New Digital write Task". Select this option to
open the read task configuration dialog.

### From The Layout Selector

To create a digital write task from the layout selector, click on the "+" button in the
top right corner and select "NI Digital Write Task".

## Configure the Task

### <StepText level="h3" step={1}>Select your NI Device</StepText>

The first step is to select the NI device you'd like to write to the outputs of. Use the
dropdown menu in the top left corner to do so.

  id="device-drivers/ni/digital-write-task/digital-write-task-select-device"
/>

### <StepText level="h3" step={2}>Add Channels to the Task</StepText>

Next, you'll need to add the channels you'd like to write to. Click the "+" button in
the channels section. Then, click on the new channel in the list to configure it.

You'll need to select both a digital output port and line to write to. You'll also need
to select the command channel the task will listen to, and the state channel that will
be updated when the command is processed.

/>

### <StepText level="h3" step={3}>Configure the State Update Rate</StepText>

The state update rate determines how often the state channels in the task are updated.
Set the rate higher in scenarios that require quick response times.

    style={{ width: "50%", minWidth: 200 }}
  />
</div>

## Start the Task

Once you've added all of the channels you need and have configured sampling rates, hit
the "Configure" button. If there are no errors, Synnax will acknowledge the configured
task and enable the Play (<Icon.Play />) button in the dialog. Click this button to
start the task.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Starting and stopping a task does not re-apply the task configuration. If you've made
  changes to the configuration, you'll need to re-configure the task by hitting the "
  Configure" button.
