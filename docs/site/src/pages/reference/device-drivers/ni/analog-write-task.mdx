An analog write task is used for sending commands to the analog outputs of your NI
cards. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create an analog write task
using the Synnax Console.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the task, you'll need to have connected and configured an NI device
and created the relevant channels in Synnax. Check out the
[Configure Device](/reference/device-drivers/ni/configure-device) guide for more
information.

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with hardware devices in Synnax. Tasks
can be used for both control and data acquisition purposes. In the context of the NI
Driver, an analog wirte task defines a background process that writes to the analog
outputs of your device based on values written to Synnax
[command channels](#how-commands-work-in-synnax).

An analog write task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. We
permanently store the configuration of the task in Synnax, so it's easy to set up
multiple tasks for different purposes.

## How Commands Work in Synnax

Commands in Synnax require two types of channels: a command channel and state channel.
Command channels signal a task to set the value of an analog output. To set an analog
output to a specific value, you would write the desired value to the command channel.

A command channel for an analog output might be `my_temp_card_ao_0_1_cmd`, where
`my_temp_card` is the device identifier, `ao_0_1` is the port and line of the analog
output, and `_cmd` indicates that it's a command channel.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Command channels also have an associated index channel that stores the timestamps at
  which commands were sent. This channel is suffixed with `_cmd_time`. For the command
  channel `my_temp_card_ao_0_1_cmd`, the index channel would be
  `my_temp_card_ao_0_1_cmd_time`.
</Note.Note>

State channels represent the current state of the analog output. When you send a
command, the corresponding analog write task will process the command and update the
value in the state channel.

State channels are typically suffixed with `_state`. A state channel maintains the same
format as its corresponding command channel, but suffixed with `_state` instead of
`_cmd`.

As an example, to configure a setpoint in the [schematic](/reference/console/schematics)
to write to an analog output, you would set the `command` field to the command channel
of the analog output. Setting the setpoint would send a command to the analog output.

Using two channels provides a guarantee that a particular command was acknowledged by a
running task.

## Open the Task Configuration Dialog

### From the Resources Toolbar

To create an analog write task from the resources toolbar, open the Synnax Console and
click on the resources (<Icon.Resources />) toolbar in the left sidebar. Find the device
you'd like to create the task for, right-click on it, and select "Create Analog Write
Task".

### From the Command Palette

To create an analog write task from the command palette, open the Synnax Console and
click on the Quick Search & Command Palette at the top. You can also open this palette
with `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type "NI".
You'll see an option called "Create a New Analog Write Task". Select this option to open
the write task configuration dialog.

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/ni/analog-write-task/create-palette" />

### From The Layout Selector

To create an analog write task from the layout selector, click on the "+" button in the
top right corner and select "NI Analog Write Task".

## Configure the Task

### <StepText level="h3" step={1}>Select your NI Device</StepText>

The first step is to select the NI device you'd like to write to the outputs of. Use the
dropdown menu in the top left corner to do so.

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/ni/analog-write-task/select-device" />

### <StepText level="h3" step={2}>Add Channels to the Task</StepText>

Next, you'll need to add the channels you'd like to write to. Click the "+" button in
the channels section. Once you have a channel, you can select the channel type, scaling,
and other details in the form on the right.

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/ni/analog-write-task/add-channel" />

### <StepText level="h3" step={3}>Configure the State Update Rate</StepText>

The state update rate determines how often the state channels in the task are updated.
Set the rate higher in scenarios that require quick response times.

## Start the Task

Once you've added all of the channels you need and have configured sampling rates, hit
the "Configure" button. If there are no errors, Synnax will acknowledge the configured
task and enable the Play (<Icon.Play />) button in the dialog. Click this button to
start the task.

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/ni/analog-write-task/start" />

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Starting and stopping a task does not re-apply the task configuration. If you've made
  changes to the configuration, you'll need to re-configure the task by hitting the
  "Configure" button.
