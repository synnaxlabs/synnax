The [LabJack](https://support.labjack.com/docs/?l=en) LJM library allows Synnax to
directly connect to your LabJack T-series devices. This page will walk you through some
of the important prerequisites necessary to get started with the LabJack driver.

## Supported Devices

Synnax supports reading and writing data to all LabJack devices that are supported by
the
[LJM Library](https://support.labjack.com/docs/ljm-software-installer-downloads-t4-t7-t8-digit).

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  Currently, only T-Series LabJack devices are supported by Synnax. If you are
  interested in using Synnax with other devices, please [contact
  us](https://www.synnaxlabs.com/contact).

## Supported Operating Systems

The LabJack driver supports Linux, Windows, and macOS machines that have the LJM library
installed. The driver will not be able to connect to external devices when running
within a containerized environment (even if that container is running on a supported
OS).

## Installation

The LabJack driver comes pre-installed with every Synnax Cluster, and will automatically
detect LabJack devices connected to the same host machine as the cluster.

We also offer a standalone driver that can be used to acquire data from LabJack devices
on host machines separate from the Synnax Cluster. For details on when this is useful,
see the [getting started guide](/reference/device-drivers/get-started). For standalone
driver installation instructions, see the
[standalone driver](/reference/device-drivers/standalone) page.

### Installing LJM

The LabJack LJM library must be installed for Synnax to communicate with your LabJack
hardware. Instructions for installing LJM software can be found on the
[LabJack website.](<https://support.labjack.com/docs/ljm-software-installer-downloads-t4-t7-t8-digit#LJMSoftwareInstallerDownloads-T4,T7,T8,Digit-Windows(x86_64)LJMSoftwareInstallerDownloads>)

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  If you have a Synnax cluster already running before installing LJM, you'll need to
  restart the cluster for Synnax to recognize the LJM installation.
