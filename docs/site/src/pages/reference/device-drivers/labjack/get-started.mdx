The Synnax Driver supports reading and writing data from LabJack T-series devices. This
page will walk you through the steps to start acquiring data from your LabJack devices
using the Driver.

## Supported Devices

Synnax supports reading and writing data to all LabJack devices that are supported by
the
[LJM Library](https://support.labjack.com/docs/ljm-software-installer-downloads-t4-t7-t8-digit).

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  Currently, only T-Series LabJack devices are supported by Synnax. If you are
  interested in using Synnax with other devices, please [contact
  us](https://www.synnaxlabs.com/contact).

## Supported Operating Systems

The Synnax Driver supports Linux, Windows, and macOS machines that have the LJM library
installed. The Driver will not be able to connect to external devices when running
within a containerized environment (even if that container is running on a supported
OS).

## Installation

Every instance of the [Synnax Core](/reference/core/quick-start) comes with the Synnax
Driver embedded inside, which will automatically detect LabJack devices connected to the
same host machine as the Core.

The Driver can also be installed as a separate binary to acquire data from LabJack
devices on host machines separate from the Synnax Core. For details on when this is
useful, see the [getting started guide](/reference/device-drivers/get-started). For
installation instructions, see the
[Driver installation](/reference/device-drivers/installation) page.

### Installing LJM

The LabJack LJM library must be installed for Synnax to communicate with your LabJack
hardware. Instructions for installing LJM software can be found on the
[LabJack website.](<https://support.labjack.com/docs/ljm-software-installer-downloads-t4-t7-t8-digit#LJMSoftwareInstallerDownloads-T4,T7,T8,Digit-Windows(x86_64)LJMSoftwareInstallerDownloads>)

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  If you have a Synnax Driver already running before installing LJM, you'll need to
  restart the Driver for Synnax to recognize the LJM installation.
