The read task is used for acquiring analog and digital data from LabJack devices. In
this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create a LabJack read task in Synnax.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the task, you'll need to have connected and configured a LabJack
device and created the relevant channels in Synnax. Check out the
[device configuration](/reference/device-drivers/labjack/configure-device) guide for
more information.

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with hardware devices in Synnax. Tasks
can be used for both control and data acquisition purposes. A LabJack read task defines
a background process that reads data from the analog or digital inputs on a particular
LabJack device.

A read task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. Synnax permanently
stores the configuration of the task in Synnax, so it's easy to set up multiple tasks
for different purposes.

## Important Rules for Read Tasks

There are a few important rules to keep in mind when creating a read task.

### Sample Rates

All channels in the task are sampled at the same rate. If you'd like to sample different
channels at different rates, create a separate task to do so.

#### Sampling thermocouple channels

In order to leverage the LJM's built-in thermocouple features, configuring a task with
thermocouple channels will reduce the maximum reliable sample rate you can acquire data,
compared to a task with only analog or digital input channels.

### One Running Task Per Channel

Synnax can only accept live data from a channel from one source at a time. If you have a
task running that reads from a `pressure` channel, you cannot start another task that
reads from the same channel.

## Open the Task Configuration Dialog

### From the Resources Toolbar

To create a read task from the resources toolbar, open the Synnax Console and click on
the "Resources" tab in the left sidebar. Find the device you'd like to create the task
for, right-click on it, and select "Create Read Task".

### From the Command Palette

To create a read task from the command palette, open the Synnax Console and click on the
Quick Search & Command Palette at the top. You can also open this palette with
`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is "`>`"), type
"LabJack". You'll see an option called "Create a LabJack Read Task". Select this option
to open the read task configuration dialog.

### From The Layout Selector

To create a read task from the layout selector, click on the "<Icon.Add />" button in
the top right corner and select "LabJack Read Task".

## Configuring the Task

### <StepText level="h3" step={1}>Select your Labjack Device</StepText>

The first step is to select the LabJack device you'd like to read data from. Use the
dropdown menu in the top left corner to do so.

### <StepText level="h3" step={2}>Add Channels to the Task</StepText>

Next, you'll need to add channels to read data from. Click on the Add (<Icon.Add />)
button in the channels section. Then, click on the new channel in the list to configure
it.

### <StepText level="h3" step={3}>Configure Timing</StepText>

There are two parameters to control the timing of the task: the **sample rate** and the
**stream rate**. The sample rate defines how many samples per second the task will read
from the device. The stream rate defines how often the task will stream data into
Synnax.

For example, if you set the sample rate to 10 Hz and the stream rate to 1 Hz, Synnax
will read a batch of 10 samples every second, and then forward the entire batch to the
Synnax database.

For very low rate tasks (&lt; 50Hz), we recommend setting the stream rate to the same
value as the sample rate. For higher rate tasks, lowering the stream rate can
significantly improve performance. It's best to keep the stream rate below 50Hz unless
you need to quickly process incoming data in real-time.

    id="device-drivers/ni/analog-read-task/analog-read-task-timing"
    style={{ width: "50%", minWidth: 200 }}
  />
</div>

### <StepText level="h3" step={4}>Enable / Disable Data Saving</StepText>

Data saving defines whether acquired data will be permanently stored in Synnax. When
enabled, Synnax will both stream and store data. When disabled, Synnax will only stream
data for real-time visualization, control, and processing. Historical data will not be
available for review.

We recommend turning data saving off when you're testing a new task or running
operations where historical data saving is not important.

## Start the Task

Once you'd added all of the channels you need and have configured the task timing, hit
the "Configure" button. If there are no errors, Synnax will acknowledge the configured
task and enable the Play (<Icon.Play />) button in the dialog. Click this button to
start the task.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Starting and stopping a task does not re-apply the task configuration. If you've made
  changes to the configuration, you'll need to re-configure the task by hitting the "
  Configure" button.
