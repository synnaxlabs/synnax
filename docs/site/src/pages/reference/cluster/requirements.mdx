This page lists the hardware and software requirements for deploying a Synnax
cluster.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Operating System

A Synnax node can run on Linux, MacOS, Windows, or any containerized
environment.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Networking

Nodes gossip with each other at regular intervals to share information about
cluster state and health. They also communicate with each other to read and
write data to the cluster. To support this, Synnax requires that every node can
reach **all** other nodes in the cluster.

## Hardware

Node hardware requirements vary depending on the workload you are running. The
following table provides bare minimum requirements for testing as well as a
recommended minimum configuration for production.
