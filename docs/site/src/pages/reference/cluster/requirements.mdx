This page lists the hardware and software requirements for deploying a Synnax cluster to
production.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Operating System

A Synnax cluster can run on Linux, macOS, Windows, or a containerized environment.

For most production scenarios, we recommend running a glibc-based Linux distribution and
a Linux kernel version from the last 5 years, such as
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/server),
[Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux),
or [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/).

### Device Driver Compatibility

If you plan on using our device drivers to integrate directly with your hardware, only
certain operating systems are supported.

- [National Instruments](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/device-drivers/ni/get-started) -
  Windows, Linux
- [LabJack](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/device-drivers/labjack/get-started) -
  Windows, Linux, MacOS
- [OPC UA](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/device-drivers/opc-ua/get-started) -
  Windows, Linux, MacOS, or a containerized environment

## Hardware

Cluster hardware requirements vary depending on your data acquisition and control
workload.

### Calculating Workload

The first step in sizing a system to meet your requirements is to calculate the total
sample throughput of your workload.

- The approximate number of channels you'll be acquiring data from. This includes sensor
  sensor, actuators, logs, and any other channels you may be using.
- The average rate at which you'll be writing data for each channel. To be even more
  precise, separate your channels into groups with specific sampling rates.

The total throughput is the number of channels multiplied by the average rate at which
you'll be writing data for each channel.

For example, if we have three groups of channels:

- 10 high speed at 25Khz - 250K samples/s
- 100 medium speed at 100Hz - 10K samples/s
- 20 actuators sending states at 50Hz - 1K samples/s

The total throughput for our cluster is 250K + 10K + 1K = 261K samples/s.

### Workload-Based Recommendations

The following table provides a recommended hardware configuration for a Synnax cluster
to run.

### Production Recommendations

The following table provides a recommended hardware configuration for a Synnax cluster
to run.

## Networking

Nodes gossip with each other at regular intervals to share information about cluster
state and health. They also communicate with each other to read and write data to the
cluster. To support this, Synnax requires that every node can reach **all** other nodes
in the cluster.
