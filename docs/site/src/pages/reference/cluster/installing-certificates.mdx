This page is a guide on how to efficiently install CA certificates on client machines
to enable communication with a cluster using a self-signed certificate. Select your
operating system below.

## Windows

To start off, you'll need to pull the CA certificate from the cluster. Once you have the
certificate, you can install it using the `Import-Certificate` command. Note that you
may need to open powershell as an administrator to run the command.

```powershell
Import-Certificate -FilePath PATH_TO_CA_CRT -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Root
```

To start off, you'll need to pull the CA certificate from the cluster. If you have ssh
access to the cluster, you can use the `scp` command to pull the certificate:

```bash
scp user@cluster:/path/to/ca.crt /tmp/synnax-ca.crt
```

Otherwise, you can copy and paste the certificate into a new file. Open a new terminal
and run the following command:

```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /tmp/synnax-ca.crt
```
