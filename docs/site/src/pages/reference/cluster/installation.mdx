This page will walk you through how to install the Synnax binary on Windows,
macOS, and Linux. To get started, select your operating system below:

<PlatformTabs client:only="react">

<Fragment slot="docker">

## Installing on Docker

Installing Synnax via Docker is as easy as running `docker pull` with the latest tag:

```bash
docker pull synnaxlabs/synnax:latest
```

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="linux">

## Installing on Linux

To install Synnax on a Linux distribution, run the following command to download the latest
binary:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="linux" />

We recommend you move the binary into a directory that is in your `PATH`. Most of our users
use `/usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="linux" />

If `usr/local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, you can temporarily add it by running
the following:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

Or, you can add it permanently using the following one-liner for your shell:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Or, for `zsh`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
```

If any previous versions of Synnax are installed and available on your `PATH`, you
may need to remove them to avoid conflicts.

<Note.Note variant="warning">
If you've also installed the [Synnax Python Client](../python-client/get-started),
its `synnax` command may take precedence over the one you just installed. To
avoid conflicts, rename the binary you've just installed to something else, like
`synnax-server` by running (you may need to use `sudo`):

```
mv /usr/local/bin/synnax /usr/local/bin/synnax-server
```

Then, you can run the binary using `synnax-server` instead of `synnax`.

</Note.Note>

Next, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

You may need to use `sudo` to run the above command if you do not have the
necessary permissions.

To verify that the installation was successful, run:

```bash
synnax --version
```

You should see the following output:

<SynnaxVersionOutput />

## Installing on macOS

To install Synnax on macOS, run the following command to download the latest binary:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="macos" />

We recommend you move the binary into a directory that is in your `PATH`. Most
of our users use `/usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="macos" />

If `usr/local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, you can temporarily add it by running
the following:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin

Or, you can add it permanently using the following one-liner for your shell:

```bash

  If you've also installed the [Synnax Python Client](../python-client/get-started), its
  `synnax` command may take precedence over the one you just installed. You can
  alternatively use the `synnax-server` command which has also been added to your
  `PATH`.
</Note.Note>

To verify that the installation was successful, run the following command in a **PowerShell** terminal:

```powershell
synnax --version
