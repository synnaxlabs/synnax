This page walks you through deploying a Core for production use, which requires a few
additional steps compared to development use.

<Divider.Divider x />

## License Keys

If your organization has an enterprise license for Synnax, you'll need to provide your
license key on startup. The easiest way to do this is using the `--license-key` flag
when starting the Core. Here's an example:

```sh
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --license-key=000000-00000000-0000000000
```

In production, we recommend using an environment variable or configuration file to store
your license key. This is more secure than passing the key as a command line argument.
The following example shows how to set the license key using an environment variable:

```sh
export SYNNAX_LICENSE_KEY=000000-00000000-0000000000
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090
```

To see the full list of command line options, environment variables, and configuration
file parameters, see the [CLI reference](/reference/core/cli-reference).

## Configuring TLS

We recommend using TLS for securing all communications with your Core.

### TLS Certificate Options

There are four important command line options for configuring TLS:

<Table.Data
  client:only="react"
  columns={[
    { key: "option", name: "Option", type: "code", width: 130 },
    { key: "description", name: "Description", type: "string" },
    { key: "default", name: "Default", type: "code", width: 50 },
  ]}
  data={[
    {
      option: "--certs-dir",
      description:
        "The path to a directory containing the necessary certificates for the Core to use.",
      default: '"/usr/local/synnax/certs"',
    },
    {
      option: "--ca-cert",
      description:
        "The path relative to `--certs-dir` to the certificate authority (CA) certificate. This is only required if you're using a self-signed certificate. Certificates generated by public CA's like Let's Encrypt are already trusted, so you don't need to specify this option.",
      default: '"ca.crt"',
    },
    {
      option: "--node-cert",
      description:
        "The path relative to `--certs-dir` to the node's public certificate file.",
      default: '"node.crt"',
    },
    {
      option: "--node-key",
      description: "The path relative to `--certs-dir` to the node's private key file.",
      default: '"node.key"',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Starting the Core with TLS

When starting the Core with TLS, you'll need to specify the correct options and start
the Core with the correct hostname in the `--listen` option. **The hostname must match
the hostname in the node certificate**. Here's an example for a let's encrypt
certificate:

```sh
synnax start \
  --listen=synnax.example.com:9090 \
  --mem \
  --certs-dir=/etc/letsencrypt/live/synnax.example.com/ \
  --node-cert=fullchain.pem \
  --node-key=privkey.pem \
```

## Generating Certificates

### Using Synnax's Auto-Cert Feature

The easiest way to start a secure Core using self-signed certificates is to use the
`--auto-cert` command line flag when starting the Core. This will automatically generate
all of the relevant certificates and keys for you:

```sh
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --auto-cert
```

Please note that the `--auto-cert` option will require you to install the generated CA
certificate on your client machine in order to trust the self-signed certificate
authority. We have a guide on
[deploying Synnax with self-signed certificates](/guides/sys-admin/deployment-self-signed).

### Using Let's Encrypt with Certbot

The easiest way to get started with a trusted certificate is to use
[Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to generate a certificate for your domain. Please
note that this requires your domain to be publicly accessible and have a valid DNS
record. Once you have a certificate, you can use the `--certs-dir` option to specify the
directory containing the certificate and key files. See the example above for a
reference on how to do this.

#### Important caveats when using Docker

Certbot generates symlinked certificates and keys in
`/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/`. When using Docker, you'll need to mount the
entire `/etc/letsencrypt` directory into the container, as the `live` directory contains
symlinks to the actual certificate and key files. Here's an example of how to do this:

```bash
docker run -v /etc/letsencrypt:/usr/local/synnax/certs \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  synnaxlabs/synnax \
  -l localhost:9090 \
  -vm \
  --certs-dir=/usr/local/synnax/certs/live/demo.synnaxlabs.com \
  --node-cert=fullchain.pem \
  --node-key=privkey.pem
```

### Using Your Own Certificates

When using your own certificates, you'll need to specify the `--certs-dir` option and
provide the necessary certificates and keys in that directory.
