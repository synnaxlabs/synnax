This page will walk you through how to install the Synnax binary on Windows, macOS, and
Linux. To get started, select your operating system below:

<Fragment slot="Docker">

## Installing on Docker

Installing Synnax via Docker is as easy as running `docker pull` with the latest tag:

```bash
docker pull synnaxlabs/synnax:latest
```

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="Linux">

## Installing on Linux

To install Synnax on a Linux distribution, run the following command to download the
latest binary:

<Deploy.DownloadURL os="linux" />

We recommend you move the binary into a directory that is in your `PATH`. Most of our
users use `/usr/local/bin`:

<Deploy.MoveCommand os="linux" />

If `usr/local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, you can temporarily add it by running the
following:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

Or, you can add it permanently using the following one-liner for your shell:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Or, for `zsh`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
```

If any previous versions of Synnax are installed and available on your `PATH`, you may
need to remove them to avoid conflicts.

Next, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

You may need to use `sudo` to run the above command if you do not have the necessary
permissions.

To verify that the installation was successful, run:

```bash
synnax --version
```

You should see the following output:

<Deploy.VersionOutput />

## Installing on macOS

To install Synnax on macOS, run the following command to download the latest binary:

<Deploy.DownloadURL os="macos" />

We recommend you move the binary into a directory that is in your `PATH`. Most of our
users use `/usr/local/bin`:

<Deploy.MoveCommand os="macos" />

following:

```bash
