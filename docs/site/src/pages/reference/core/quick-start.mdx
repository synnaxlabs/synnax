This page will walk you through starting a Synnax Core. To get started, select your
operating system below:

<Platform.Tabs client:only="react">
<Fragment slot="Docker">

## Using Docker

The simplest way to start a Core is by using the `synnaxlabs/synnax` Docker image:

```bash
docker run -p 9090:9090 synnaxlabs/synnax --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will pull the latest version of Synnax from Docker Hub and start a Core with the
following parameters:

`-p 9090:9090` - This maps port 9090 on the host to port 9090 in the container. This
allows access to the Synnax Core from the host machine.

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the Core will listen on. This is
the reachable address of the Core.

`--mem` - Tells the Core to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the Core to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the
[CLI Reference](/reference/core/cli-reference).

To stop the Core, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Using Linux

To start a Core on Linux, first download the latest Synnax binary by running:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="linux" />

Then, move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="linux" />

Next, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.
  You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</Note.Note>

Finally, start the Core:

```bash
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a Core with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the Core will listen on. This is
the reachable address of the Core.

`--mem` - Tells the Core to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the Core to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the
[CLI Reference](/reference/core/cli-reference).

To stop the Core, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Using macOS

To start a Core on macOS, first download the latest Synnax binary by running:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="macos" />

Next, move the binary to `usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="macos" />

Then, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.
  You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</Note.Note>

Finally, start the Core:

```bash
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a Core with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the Core will listen on. This is
the reachable address of the Core.

`--mem` - Tells the Core to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the Core to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the
[CLI Reference](/reference/core/cli-reference).

To stop the Core, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

To start the Core, run this command in a **PowerShell** terminal:

```powershell
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a Core with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the Core will listen on. This is
the reachable address of the Core.

`--mem` - Tells the Core to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the Core to run without TLS.

The [Core CLI Reference](/reference/core/cli-reference) contains more details about
these flags.

To stop the Core, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
