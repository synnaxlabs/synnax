This page lists the hardware and software requirements for deploying a Synnax Core to
production.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Operating System

A Synnax Core can run on Linux, macOS, Windows, or a containerized environment.

For most production scenarios, we recommend running a glibc-based Linux distribution and
a Linux kernel version from the last 5 years, such as
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/server),
[Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux),
or [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/).

### Synnax Driver Compatibility

If you plan on using the Synnax Driver to integrate directly with your hardware, only
certain operating systems are supported.

- [National Instruments](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/driver/ni) - Windows,
  Linux
- [LabJack](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/driver/labjack) - Windows, Linux,
  macOS
- [OPC UA](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/driver/opc-ua) - Windows, Linux, macOS,
  or a containerized environment
- [Modbus](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/reference/driver/modbus) - Windows, Linux, macOS,
  or a containerized environment

## Hardware

Core hardware requirements vary depending on your data acquisition and control workload.

### Calculating Workload

The first step in sizing a system to meet your requirements is to calculate the total
sample throughput of your workload.

- The approximate number of channels you'll be acquiring data from. This includes
  sensors, actuators, logs, and any other channels you may be using.
- The average rate at which you'll be writing data for each channel. To be even more
  precise, separate your channels into groups with specific sampling rates.

The total throughput is the number of channels multiplied by the average rate at which
you'll be writing data for each channel.

For example, if we have three groups of channels:

- 10 high speed at 25 kHz -> 250k samples/s
- 100 medium speed at 100 Hz -> 10k samples/s
- 20 actuators sending states at 50 Hz -> 1k samples/s

The total throughput for our Core is 250k + 10k + 1k = 261k samples/s.

### Workload-Based Minimum Requirements

Once you've calculated your total throughput, use the following table to determine the
_minimum_ hardware requirements for your Core.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <th>Throughput (samples/s)</th>
    <th>CPU (Cores) </th>
    <th>Memory (GB)</th>
    <th>Storage (GB)</th>
    <th>Storage Throughput (MB/s)</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>250k</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>120</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>500k</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>200</td>
      <td>1000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1M</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>500</td>
      <td>600</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2M</td>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>32</td>
      <td>1000</td>
      <td>1200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4M</td>
      <td>24</td>
      <td>64</td>
      <td>2000</td>
      <td>2400</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

<Note.Note variant="info">
  When operating Synnax in mission critical environments, we recommend provisioning
  hardware that is at least twice the minimum requirements. This leaves ample room for
  workload growth and unexpected spikes in throughput.
</Note.Note>

### Storage

We highly recommend using a high-performance M.2, NVMe, or SATA SSD for storage. This
recommendation becomes more of a requirement if you have any very high throughput data
acquisition channels (10 kHz or higher).

### CPU

The Synnax Core is CPU intensive during data ingestion, streaming, and control
operations. Modern multi-core processors perform best, and are a must when working in
safety/performance critical environments.

For production deployments, we recommend using a minimum four core processors from one
of the following families:

- Intel x86-64 processors (Xeon or Core i7/i9 series).
- AMD x86-64 processors (EPYC or Ryzen series).
- Apple Silicon Chips on MacOS (M1/M2/M3 series).

Avoid single or dual core processors for anything beyond development or testing
environments.

If you plan on using large numbers of
[calculated channels](/reference/console/calculated-channels), increase the number of
cores for your deployment.

### Memory

The Synnax Core is generally less memory-intensive than it is storage- or
compute-intensive. For most production deployments, we recommend using a minimum of 8 GB
of RAM.

## Network

Synnax Cores communicate using TCP and/or UDP protocols for coordination, data
replication, and client connections. Given Synnax's high-performance capabilities for
both data acquisition and control operations, the network infrastructure must be
designed to handle substantial throughput with minimal latency.

### Network Interface Requirements

For production deployments, we recommend the following network interface specifications:

#### Minimum Requirements

- 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) network interface cards (NICs)
- Full-duplex operation support
- Hardware-based packet processing capabilities

#### High-Performance Scenarios

- 25 Gigabit Ethernet (25GbE) or higher for workloads exceeding 2M samples/s
- Multiple NICs for redundancy and load balancing in mission-critical environments
- RDMA-capable NICs for ultra-low latency applications

### Switch Infrastructure

Network switches should be selected and configured to minimize latency and maximize
throughput:

- **Low-Latency Switches** -> Use enterprise-grade switches with sub-microsecond
  port-to-port latency.
- **Non-Blocking Architecture** -> Ensure switches provide full line-rate forwarding
  across all ports.
- **Buffer Management** -> Configure appropriate buffer sizes to handle bursty traffic
  patterns common in data acquisition workloads.
- **Quality of Service (QoS)** -> Implement traffic prioritization to ensure control
  commands receive priority over bulk data transfers.

### Cabling and Physical Infrastructure

For optimal performance, especially over longer distances:

- **Fiber Optic Cabling** -> Use single-mode or multi-mode fiber for runs longer than
  100 meters.
- **Direct Attach Cables (DAC)** -> Acceptable for short runs (< 10 meters) between
  adjacent equipment.

### Network Security and Isolation

<Note.Note variant="error">
  **Critical Security & Performance Requirement** -> Never use public internet
  connections for control operations. Control systems must operate on isolated,
  dedicated networks.
</Note.Note>

For production control environments:

- **Isolated Networks**: Deploy Synnax Cores on dedicated, air-gapped networks separate
  from corporate IT infrastructure.
- **Network Segmentation**: Use VLANs or physical separation to isolate control traffic
  from data acquisition traffic.
- **Firewall Protection**: Implement network firewalls with strict access control
  policies.
- **VPN Access**: When remote access is required, use industrial-grade VPN solutions
  with multi-factor authentication.
