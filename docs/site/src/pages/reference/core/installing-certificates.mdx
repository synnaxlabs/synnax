This page is a guide on how to efficiently install CA certificates on client machines to
enable communication with a cluster using a self-signed certificate. Select your
operating system below.

To start off, you'll need to pull the CA certificate from the cluster. Once you have the
certificate, you can install it using the `Import-Certificate` command. Note that you
may need to open powershell as an administrator to run the command.

```powershell
Import-Certificate -FilePath PATH_TO_CA_CRT -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Root
```

To start off, you'll need to pull the CA certificate from the cluster. If you have ssh
access to the cluster, you can use the `scp` command to pull the certificate:

```bash
scp user@cluster:/path/to/ca.crt /tmp/synnax-ca.crt
```

Otherwise, you can copy and paste the certificate into a new file. Open a new terminal
and run the following command:

```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /tmp/synnax-ca.crt
```
