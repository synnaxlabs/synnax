The first step to start acquiring data and sending commands to your LabJack devices is
to connect and configure your device.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using your LabJack hardware with Synnax, you will need the
following:

1. A [Synnax Core](/reference/core/quick-start) running on your network.
2. A [Synnax Driver](/reference/driver/get-started) running on your network. This Driver
   must be connected to the Core and running on the same machine as your LabJack
   hardware is connected to.
3. The
   [LJM library](https://support.labjack.com/docs/ljm-software-installer-downloads-t4-t7-t8-digit)
   installed on the machine running the Synnax Driver.
4. The [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started) installed on your local machine
   and connected to the Core.

## <StepText level="h2" step={1}>Select a Device to Configure</StepText>

Synnax will automatically detect new LabJack devices, and display a notification in the
Console when a new device is connected. To start configuring the device, find the device
in the Devices Toolbar, right click on the device and select "Configure".

## <StepText level="h2" step={2}>Name Your Device</StepText>

The first step in the configuration dialog will prompt you to name your device. This
name will be used to identify the device in Synnax.

## <StepText level="h2" step={3}> Set the Device Identifier</StepText>

Next, you'll need to set a short device identifier. This identifier will prefix the
names of all of the channels on your device. Synnax will automatically suggest a few
identifiers, although you're welcome to create your own. We recommend keeping this as
short as possible, while still uniquely identifying the device.

<Image client:only="react" id="device-drivers/labjack/configure-device/identifier" />

<Divider.Divider x />

## <StepText level="h2" step={3}>Save the Configuration</StepText>

Once you're happy with the name and identifier, the last step is to save the
configuration by hitting the blue "Save" button in the bottom-right corner.
