The first step to start acquiring data and sending commands to your LabJack devices is
to connect and configure your device.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using your LabJack hardware with Synnax, you will need to ensure that
you have the following:

1. A [Synnax Core](/reference/core/quick-start) running on your network.
2. A [Synnax Driver](/reference/driver/get-started) running on your network. This Driver
   must be connected to the Core and running on the same machine as your LabJack hardware is
   connected to.
3. The
   [LJM library](https://support.labjack.com/docs/ljm-software-installer-downloads-t4-t7-t8-digit)
   installed on the machine running the Synnax Driver.
4. The [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started) installed on your local machine.

## <StepText level="h2" step={1}>Select a Device to Configure</StepText>

Synnax will automatically detect new LabJack devices, and display a notification in the
Console when a new device is connected. To start configuring the device, find the device
in the Devices Toolbar, right click on the device and select "Configure".

<Text.Text slot="summary" level="p"><Icon.Play /> Example</Text.Text>

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/labjack/configure-device/open" />

</ExampleDetails>

## <StepText level="h2" step={2}>Name Your Device</StepText>

This name will be used to identify the device in Synnax.

<ExampleDetails>
<Text.Text slot="summary" level="p"><Icon.Play /> Example</Text.Text>

<Image client:only="react" id="device-drivers/labjack/configure-device/name" />

</ExampleDetails>

<Divider.Divider x />

## <StepText level="h2" step={3}>Set the Device Identifier</StepText>

The identifier will be used to
prefix the names of all of the channels on your device. Suggestions are automatically generated, although you're welcome to choose your own.

<ExampleDetails>
<Text.Text slot="summary" level="p"><Icon.Play /> Example</Text.Text>

<Image client:only="react" id="device-drivers/labjack/configure-device/identifier" />

</ExampleDetails>

<Divider.Divider x />

## <StepText level="h2" step={4}>Save the Configuration</StepText>

Once you're happy with the name and identifier, save the
configuration by hitting the blue "Save" button.
