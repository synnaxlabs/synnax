The Synnax Driver supports reading and writing data from LabJack devices. This page will
walk you through the steps to start acquiring data from your LabJack devices using the
Driver.

## Supported Devices

Synnax supports reading and writing data to all LabJack T-Series devices that are
supported by the
[LJM Library](https://support.labjack.com/docs/ljm-software-installer-downloads-t4-t7-t8-digit).

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  Currently, only T-Series LabJack devices are supported by Synnax. If you are
  interested in using Synnax with other devices, please [contact
  us](https://www.synnaxlabs.com/contact).

## Supported Operating Systems

The Synnax Driver supports Linux, Windows, and macOS machines that have the LJM library
installed. The Driver will not be able to connect to external devices when running
within a containerized environment (even if that container is running on a supported
OS).

## Installation

Every instance of the [Synnax Core](/reference/core/quick-start) comes with the Synnax
Driver embedded inside, which will automatically detect LabJack devices connected to the
same host machine as the Core.

The Driver can also be installed as a [separate binary](/reference/driver/installation)
to acquire data from LabJack devices on host machines separate from the Synnax Core.

### Installing LJM

The
[LabJack LJM library](https://support.labjack.com/docs/ljm-software-installer-downloads-t4-t7-t8-digit)
must be installed for the Driver to communicate with your LabJack devices.

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  If you have a Synnax Driver already running before installing LJM, you'll need to
  restart the Driver for so it can recognize the LJM installation.
