The [Modbus](https://modbus.org) protocol allows the Synnax Driver to connect to a wide
range of industrial devices and PLCs that support Modbus TCP/IP communication. This page
will walk you through some of the important prerequisites necessary to get started with
the Modbus driver.

## Supported Protocol

**The Synnax Driver supports Modbus TCP/IP**, which is the Ethernet-based variant of the
Modbus protocol. The Driver does not currently support Modbus RTU (serial) or Modbus
ASCII.

Modbus TCP is one of the most widely supported industrial protocols and is commonly used
for:

- Programmable logic controllers (PLCs)
- Variable-frequency drives (VFDs)
- Power meters and energy monitoring devices
- Temperature and humidity controllers
- Industrial I/O modules
- Building automation systems

## Network Requirements

To connect to a Modbus TCP server, you'll need:

1. **Network connectivity** - The machine running the Synnax Driver must be able to
   reach the Modbus server over TCP/IP (typically port 502)
2. **Server IP address** - The IP address or hostname of the Modbus server
3. **Register documentation** - Documentation for your device's Modbus register map,
   which specifies which addresses correspond to which measurements or control points

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Many Modbus servers use the default port 502, but some may use alternative ports.
  Check your server's documentation for the correct port number.

## Installation

Every instance of the [Synnax Core](/reference/cluster/quick-start) comes with the
Synnax Driver embedded inside, which will automatically support Modbus connections
without any additional software installation.

The Driver can also be installed as a separate binary to acquire data from Modbus
servers on host machines separate from the Synnax Core. For details on when this is
useful, see the [getting started guide](/reference/driver/get-started). For installation
instructions, see the [Driver installation](/reference/driver/installation) page.

## Supported Operating Systems

The Modbus driver supports Linux, Windows, and macOS machines. The driver can run within
containerized environments as long as the container has network access to the Modbus
servers.

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  The Modbus driver is **not available** on NI Linux Real-Time controllers (CompactRIO,
  PXI systems). For these platforms, use the [NI
  driver](/reference/driver/ni/get-started) or [OPC
  UA](/reference/driver/opc-ua/connect-server) if your device supports it.

## Register Types and Data Types

Modbus supports four types of data storage areas:

- **Coils** - Read/write discrete outputs (1-bit boolean)
- **Discrete Inputs** - Read-only discrete inputs (1-bit boolean)
- **Holding Registers** - Read/write analog values (16-bit, configurable data types)
- **Input Registers** - Read-only analog values (16-bit, configurable data types)

For Holding Registers and Input Registers, Synnax supports multiple data types including
`int16`, `uint16`, `int32`, `uint32`, and `float32`. See the
[Read Task documentation](/reference/driver/modbus/read-task#data-types-for-registers)
for more details.
