The [OPC UA](https://opcfoundation.org) (Open Platform Communications Unified
Architecture) protocol allows the Synnax Driver to connect to a wide range of industrial
devices, PLCs, and SCADA systems that support OPC UA communication. This page will walk
you through some of the important prerequisites necessary to get started with the OPC UA
driver.

## Supported Protocol

**The Synnax Driver supports OPC UA**, which is a platform-independent, service-oriented
architecture for industrial automation. OPC UA is widely supported and is commonly used
for:

- Programmable logic controllers (PLCs)
- SCADA systems and HMIs
- Industrial sensors and actuators
- Distributed control systems (DCS)
- Manufacturing execution systems (MES)
- Building automation systems
- Process control systems

<Note.Note variant="info" className="compact">
  The Synnax OPC UA driver supports both secure and non-secure connections, including
  anonymous, username/password, and certificate-based authentication.
