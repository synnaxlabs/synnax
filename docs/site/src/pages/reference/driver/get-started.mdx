The Synnax Driver supports hardware from a a variety of vendors, including
[National Instruments](https://www.ni.com), [LabJack](https://labjack.com),
[OPC UA](https://opcfoundation.org) servers, and [Modbus TCP](https://modbus.org)
servers. Synnax also supports building custom drivers for devices that are not natively
supported.

## Synnax Driver

The Synnax Driver natively supports reading and writing data for
[National Instruments](/reference/driver/ni/get-started) hardware,
[OPC UA](/reference/driver/opc-ua/connect-server) servers,
[Modbus](/reference/driver/modbus/get-started) servers, and
[LabJack](/reference/driver/labjack/get-started) devices.

### Embedded Driver

Every instance of the [Synnax Core](/reference/core/quick-start) comes with the Synnax
Driver embedded inside. This Driver will run on the same machine as the Synnax Core, and
starts automatically when the Core starts. The embedded Driver is recommended for most
users.

### Driver Installation

The [Synnax Driver](/reference/driver/installation) can also be installed as a separate
binary that can run on a different machine from the Synnax Core. It is used to integrate
data acquisition devices across multiple machines. The Driver connects to a Core over
the network.

#### Support for NI Linux Real-Time

The Driver supports deployment on
[NI Linux Real-Time](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/linux/introduction-to-ni-linux-real-time.html)
controllers, such as [NI CompactRIO](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/compactrio.html) and
[NI PXI](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/pxi.html) systems.

In addition to performing data acquisition and control tasks on real-time controllers,
the Driver also supports running
[embedded control sequences](/reference/control/embedded/get-started) on the real-time
controller, allowing for precisely timed control sequences that run close to the
hardware.

## Building a Custom Driver

If you don't see a driver for your hardware, you can build your own using the
[Python client](/reference/python-client/device-driver).
