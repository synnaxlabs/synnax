Now that you've configured your NI device, you're ready to create tasks to communicate
with it. This guide covers the fundamentals of working with tasks in the NI driver.

<Divider.Divider x />

## Prerequisites

Before creating any tasks, you'll need to have
[connected and configured an NI device](/reference/driver/ni/configure-device).

<Divider.Divider x />

## What Are Tasks?

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with hardware devices in Synnax. Tasks
can be used for both control and data acquisition purposes. In the context of the NI
Driver, a task defines a background process that either reads data from or writes data
to your NI hardware.

Tasks can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. Synnax permanently stores
the configuration of each task, so it's easy to set up multiple tasks for different
purposes and switch between them as needed.

## Opening Task Configuration Dialogs

There are three ways to create and open a task configuration dialog in Synnax. The
examples below demonstrate creating an analog read task, but the same methods apply to
all task types (analog write, digital read, digital write, etc.).

### From the Devices Toolbar

To create a task from the Devices Toolbar, open the Console and click on the device
icon (<Icon.Device />) on the left-hand side of the screen. Find the device you'd like
to create the task for, right-click on it, and select the appropriate task type (e.g.,
"Create analog read task").

### From the Command Palette

To create a task from the command palette, open the Console and click on the Search and
Command Palette at the top. You can also open this palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` on
Windows and `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type "NI".
You'll see options for creating different NI task types. Select the one you need to open
the task configuration dialog.

### From The Layout Selector

To create a task from the layout selector, click on the add icon (<Icon.Add />) in the
top-right corner of the central mosaic and select the appropriate NI task type from the
menu.

## Starting and Stopping Tasks

Once you've configured your task (adding channels, setting timing parameters, etc.),
you'll need to apply the configuration before starting the task.

### Configuring the Task

After making any changes to your task configuration, click the "Configure" button. If
there are no errors, Synnax will acknowledge the configured task and enable the Play
(<Icon.Play />) button in the dialog.

### Starting the Task

Click the Play (<Icon.Play />) button to start the task. The task will begin executing
in the background, either reading data from or writing data to your hardware.

### Stopping the Task

To stop a running task, click the Stop button. The task will stop executing, but the
configuration will remain saved.

<Note.Note variant="info">
  Starting and stopping a task does not re-apply the task configuration. If you've made
  changes to the configuration, you'll need to re-configure the task by clicking the
  "Configure" button before those changes take effect.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics of working with tasks, you can learn about specific
task types:

- [Analog Read Task](/reference/driver/ni/analog-read-task) - Acquire data from analog
  inputs
- [Analog Write Task](/reference/driver/ni/analog-write-task) - Send commands to analog
  outputs
- [Digital Read Task](/reference/driver/ni/digital-read-task) - Acquire data from
  digital inputs
- [Digital Write Task](/reference/driver/ni/digital-write-task) - Send commands to
  digital outputs
